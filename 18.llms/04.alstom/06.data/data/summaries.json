  "Lifting Plan.pdf": " The 'Lifting Plan' document is a safety and environmental plan for the Alstom New Cabling Factory project at Borg El Arab, Egypt. The plan is effective from May 8, 2025, with revisions numbered as Rev. No.: 2025 A.\n\nThe main scope of this plan is to position caravans and site units delivered by flatbeds in the Site Mobilization Zone of the factory. To achieve this, various pieces of lifting equipment are specified, including a 50-ton mobile crane, flatbed trucks (12â18 m long), an adjustable spreader beam, and polyester slings/shackles.\n\nThe lifting area layout is detailed in the document, including crane positions, truck routes, and exclusion zones. The execution procedure outlines four steps: preparation, delivery, lifting, and final positioning of caravans. During preparation, ground compaction may be necessary, and the crane will be positioned based on the lift radius. Safety barriers are installed around the lift area during this phase. In the delivery stage, trucks enter via the Main Gate, park at the Loading & Unloading Zone beside the crane, receive guidance from a spotter and HSE personnel.\n\nDuring lifting, a spreader beam with a 4-point sling will be used to hoist caravans from trailers slowly, and a banksman will guide the operator to place them on their foundations. Once the caravans are in position, they will be set on blocks/footings, and their alignment and stability will be verified.\n\nThroughout this plan, safety and environmental concerns are emphasized, with clear procedures for vehicle delivery, lifting operations, and final positioning of equipment."
