Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object is a table in an Oracle ERP system that contains detailed information about all the invoices processed in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table serves as a central repository for invoice data, which is crucial for financial reporting, vendor payment tracking, and auditing purposes.

Column Descriptions:

1. INVOICE_ID: This is a unique identifier for each invoice in the system. It is likely an auto-incrementing integer.

2. LAST_UPDATE_DATE: This timestamp indicates the most recent date and time when the invoice record was updated.

3. LAST_UPDATED_BY: This field represents the ID of the user who last updated the invoice record.

4. VENDOR_ID: This is a unique identifier for the vendor associated with the invoice.

5. INVOICE_NUM: This is the number of the invoice as provided by the vendor.

6. SET_OF_BOOKS_ID: This ID represents the set of financial books to which the invoice belongs. This is useful for companies that maintain multiple sets of books for different purposes or regions.

7. INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE: This field indicates the currency in which the invoice was issued.

8. PAYMENT_CURRENCY_CODE: This field indicates the currency used for payment of the invoice.

9. PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE: This is the exchange rate used for converting the invoice currency to the payment currency.

10. INVOICE_AMOUNT: This is the total amount of the invoice in the invoice currency.

11. VENDOR_SITE_ID: This ID represents the specific location of the vendor associated with the invoice.

12. AMOUNT_PAID: This is the amount that has been paid towards the invoice in the payment currency.

13. DISCOUNT_AMOUNT_TAKEN: This field represents any discounts that were applied to the invoice.

14. INVOICE_DATE: This is the date when the invoice was issued.

15. SOURCE: This field indicates the source or method of invoice entry.

16. INVOICE_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE: This code represents the type of the invoice, such as "STANDARD", "CREDIT", or "PREPAYMENT".

17. DESCRIPTION: This field contains a description or additional details about the invoice.

18. BATCH_ID: This ID represents the batch in which the invoice was processed.

19. AMOUNT_APPLICABLE_TO_DISCOUNT: This is the portion of the invoice amount that is eligible for discount.

20. TAX_AMOUNT: This field represents the amount of tax included in the invoice.

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table is likely related to other tables in the AP module, such as vendor tables (via VENDOR_ID and VENDOR_SITE_ID), user tables (via LAST_UPDATED_BY), and financial books tables (via SET_OF_BOOKS_ID). The relationships between these tables enable comprehensive tracking and reporting of invoice and payment data.

8. CREATED_BY: This is the identifier of the user who created the invoice record.
9. BASE_AMOUNT: This is the base amount of the invoice. The presence of NaN values suggests that this field may not always be populated.
10. VAT_CODE: This field represents the code for the Value Added Tax (VAT) associated with the invoice. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
11. LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN: This is the identifier of the user who last updated the invoice record.
12. EXCLUSIVE_PAYMENT_FLAG: This flag indicates whether the invoice has an exclusive payment or not. The meaning of 'exclusive payment' is not clear from the data provided.
13. PO_HEADER_ID: This is the unique identifier for the Purchase Order associated with the invoice. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
14. FREIGHT_AMOUNT: This is the freight amount associated with the invoice. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
15. GOODS_RECEIVED_DATE: This is the date when the goods associated with the invoice were received. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
16. INVOICE_RECEIVED_DATE: This is the date when the invoice was received. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
17. VOUCHER_NUM: This is the voucher number associated with the invoice. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
18. APPROVED_AMOUNT: This is the approved amount for the invoice.
19. RECURRING_PAYMENT_ID: This is the identifier for any recurring payments associated with the invoice. The absence of data in the sample suggests this field may not be in use.
20. EXCHANGE_RATE: This is the exchange rate applied to the invoice, if applicable.

This table does not appear to have explicit relationships with other tables based on the provided data. However, it can be inferred that there may be relationships with other tables in the AP module, such as those containing payment terms, payment methods, account codes, users, purchase orders, and recurring payments.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Description:** The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is a table that stores all the invoice data. This table is used to manage and track all invoices, including their exchange rates, dates, and other related information. It is an essential part of the Accounts Payable module, which is responsible for managing and recording all the company's obligations to pay its suppliers.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE`: This field indicates the type of exchange rate used for the invoice. It can be user-defined or system-defined. If the value is 'User', it means the exchange rate is manually entered by the user. If the value is 'None', it means the system-defined exchange rate is used.

2. `EXCHANGE_DATE`: This field records the date when the exchange rate is applied. It is in date format.

3. `EARLIEST_SETTLEMENT_DATE`: This field records the earliest possible date for settling the invoice. It is in date format.

4. `ORIGINAL_PREPAYMENT_AMOUNT`: This field records the original prepayment amount for the invoice, if any.

5. `DOC_SEQUENCE_ID`: This field is the unique identifier for the document sequence. It is a numeric value.

6. `DOC_SEQUENCE_VALUE`: This field represents the value of the document in the sequence. It is a numeric value.

7. `DOC_CATEGORY_CODE`: This field indicates the category of the document. It can be 'RME_SUPPLIERS', 'TRD Cash Invoice', 'STD INV', 'CRM INV', 'ADJUST INV', 'RME_PETTY_CASH', 'PREPAY INV', etc.

8. `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE13`: These are generic fields that can be used to store additional information about the invoice. The actual meaning of these fields can vary based on the business context. For example, ATTRIBUTE10 in some records is used to store the type of goods or services procured, like 'Steel', 'Petty cash', 'Procurement Concrete', etc.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

- The `DOC_SEQUENCE_ID` and `DOC_SEQUENCE_VALUE` fields are likely related to the sequencing of documents or invoices in the system. The sequence could be based on the order of creation, approval, or any other business logic.

- The `DOC_CATEGORY_CODE` field categorizes the invoices into different types. This categorization could be based on the nature of the transaction, the type of supplier, or any other business logic.

- The `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE13` fields are flexible and can be used to store various types of additional information based on business needs. For example, they could be used to store details about the goods or services procured, the department or project that the invoice is related to, or any other relevant information.

# AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL Table Documentation

## Overview
The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table is part of an Oracle ERP system and is used to store information related to invoices in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table is crucial for tracking invoice details, approval status, posting status, cancellation details, and related project accounting information.

## Column Descriptions

1. **ATTRIBUTE14, ATTRIBUTE15**: These are generic columns that can be used to store additional invoice-related information as required by the business. The specific use of these columns can vary based on the organization's needs.

2. **ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY**: This field is used to categorize the attributes stored in ATTRIBUTE14 and ATTRIBUTE15. The specific categories can vary based on the organization's needs.

3. **APPROVAL_STATUS**: This field indicates the approval status of the invoice. It can contain values such as 'Approved', 'Pending', 'Rejected', etc.

4. **APPROVAL_DESCRIPTION**: This field provides a description or notes related to the approval status of the invoice.

5. **INVOICE_DISTRIBUTION_TOTAL**: This field represents the total amount of the invoice that has been distributed for payment.

6. **POSTING_STATUS**: This field indicates the posting status of the invoice in the general ledger. It can contain values such as 'Posted', 'Not Posted', etc.

7. **PREPAY_FLAG**: This field indicates whether the invoice is a prepayment invoice. It is a boolean field and can contain values 'Y' for Yes and 'N' for No.

8. **AUTHORIZED_BY**: This field records the name of the person who authorized the invoice.

9. **CANCELLED_DATE**: This field records the date when the invoice was cancelled, if applicable.

10. **CANCELLED_BY**: This field records the name of the person who cancelled the invoice, if applicable.

11. **CANCELLED_AMOUNT**: This field records the amount that was cancelled from the invoice, if applicable.

12. **TEMP_CANCELLED_AMOUNT**: This field records a temporary cancelled amount from the invoice, if applicable. This could be used in scenarios where a cancellation is pending approval.

13. **PROJECT_ACCOUNTING_CONTEXT**: This field provides context for the invoice in relation to project accounting, if applicable.

14. **USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE**: This field records the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) transaction code associated with the invoice, if applicable.

15. **USSGL_TRX_CODE_CONTEXT**: This field provides context for the USSGL transaction code, if applicable.

16. **PROJECT_ID**: This field records the ID of the project associated with the invoice, if applicable.

17. **TASK_ID**: This field records the ID of the task associated with the invoice within a project, if applicable.

18. **EXPENDITURE_TYPE**: This field records the type of expenditure associated with the invoice, if applicable.

19. **EXPENDITURE_ITEM_DATE**: This field records the date of the expenditure item associated with the invoice, if applicable.

## Relationships and Business Logic
The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table likely interacts with other tables in the Oracle ERP system. For example, the PROJECT_ID and TASK_ID fields suggest a relationship with a projects table. The USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE field suggests a relationship with a general ledger table.

The approval and cancellation fields (APPROVAL_STATUS, APPROVAL_DESCRIPTION, CANCELLED_DATE, CANCELLED_BY, CANCELLED_AMOUNT, TEMP_CANCELLED_AMOUNT) suggest business processes around invoice approval and cancellation. The PREPAY_FLAG field suggests a business process around prepayment invoices.

Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object is a table in an Oracle ERP system that stores information related to invoices. This table is crucial for managing and tracking all the invoices in the Accounts Payable module. It contains various details about the invoices, such as the quantity, expenditure organization, vendor prepayment amount, total payment amount, withholding tax details, and various global attributes.

Column Details:

1. PA_QUANTITY: This field is likely to represent the quantity of a product or service mentioned in the invoice. However, the sample data does not provide any values for this field.

2. EXPENDITURE_ORGANIZATION_ID: This field is likely to represent the unique identifier of the organization where the expenditure occurred. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

3. PA_DEFAULT_DIST_CCID: This field is likely to represent the default distribution cost center ID. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

4. VENDOR_PREPAY_AMOUNT: This field is likely to represent the amount prepaid to the vendor. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

5. PAYMENT_AMOUNT_TOTAL: This field represents the total amount of the payment made for the invoice. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

6. AWT_FLAG: This field is likely to indicate whether Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT) is applicable or not. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

7. AWT_GROUP_ID: This field is likely to represent the group ID for Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT). The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

8. REFERENCE_1, REFERENCE_2: These fields are likely to contain any reference information related to the invoice. The sample data does not provide any values for these fields.

9. ORG_ID: This field represents the unique identifier of the organization related to the invoice. 

10. PRE_WITHHOLDING_AMOUNT: This field is likely to represent the amount withheld prior to the payment. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

11. GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE2, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE3, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE4, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE5, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE6, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE7, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE8: These fields are likely to contain global attributes related to the invoice. These could be customizable based on the organization's needs. The sample data does not provide any values for these fields.

The relationships or business logic cannot be inferred from the provided data as the sample data does not contain any values. Further information or more populated sample data would be needed to infer relationships or business logic.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** This object is part of the Oracle ERP system, specifically within the Accounts Payable (AP) module. It appears to store invoice data, including various attributes, tax calculation flags, payment cross rates, and multi-reporting currency (MRC) information. 

**Column Details:**

1. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE9 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20:** These columns are likely used to store additional information about the invoice that is not captured in other fields. The data type and usage of these fields may vary depending on the business requirements. In the provided sample data, these fields do not contain any values.

2. **AUTO_TAX_CALC_FLAG:** This field is likely a flag that indicates whether tax for the invoice is calculated automatically. The data type and usage of this field are not clear from the sample data.

3. **PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE_TYPE:** This field likely indicates the type of cross rate used for payment. Cross rates are used in foreign exchange markets where the quotation of the relative value of two currencies is made without using the U.S. dollar.

4. **PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE_DATE:** This field likely indicates the date when the cross rate for payment was determined.

5. **PAY_CURR_INVOICE_AMOUNT:** This field likely indicates the invoice amount in the payment currency.

6. **MRC_BASE_AMOUNT:** This field likely indicates the base amount in the multi-reporting currency (MRC). MRC is a feature in Oracle that allows for the recording of transactions in more than one currency.

7. **MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE:** This field likely indicates the exchange rate used for the MRC.

8. **MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE:** This field likely indicates the type of exchange rate used for the MRC.

9. **MRC_EXCHANGE_DATE:** This field likely indicates the date when the MRC exchange rate was determined.

**Relationships and Business Logic:** The table appears to be a standalone object with no explicit relationships indicated in the provided data. However, in a typical ERP system, this table would likely be related to other tables in the AP module, such as vendor details, payment terms, and tax codes. The business logic behind the data in this table would be the recording and processing of payable invoices, potentially in multiple currencies.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is used to store all the invoice data related to the Accounts Payable (AP) module. It includes details about the invoice, such as the date, amount due, approval status, and other relevant information. This data is crucial for managing and tracking payments to vendors, employees, and credit card companies.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `GL_DATE`: This field represents the General Ledger date, which is the date when the invoice is recorded in the financial accounts.

2. `AWARD_ID`: This field is used to store the identifier of the award related to the invoice, if applicable.

3. `PAID_ON_BEHALF_EMPLOYEE_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the employee on whose behalf the payment is made.

4. `AMT_DUE_CCARD_COMPANY`: This field represents the amount due to the credit card company.

5. `AMT_DUE_EMPLOYEE`: This field represents the amount due to the employee.

6. `APPROVAL_READY_FLAG`: This field indicates whether the invoice is ready for approval (Y for yes, N for no).

7. `APPROVAL_ITERATION`: This field stores the number of times the invoice has gone through the approval process.

8. `WFAPPROVAL_STATUS`: This field represents the status of the workflow approval process for the invoice.

9. `REQUESTER_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the person who requested the invoice.

10. `VALIDATION_REQUEST_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the validation request associated with the invoice.

11. `VALIDATED_TAX_AMOUNT`: This field represents the amount of tax validated on the invoice.

12. `QUICK_CREDIT`: This field indicates whether the invoice has a quick credit feature enabled (Y for yes, N for no).

13. `CREDITED_INVOICE_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the credited invoice, if applicable.

14. `DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the distribution set associated with the invoice.

15. `APPLICATION_ID`: This field stores the identifier of the application where the invoice was created.

16. `PRODUCT_TABLE`: This field stores the product table associated with the invoice.

17. `REFERENCE_KEY1`, `REFERENCE_KEY2`, `REFERENCE_KEY3`, `REFERENCE_KEY4`: These fields are used to store additional reference information related to the invoice.

**Inferred Relationships/Business Logic:**

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that each record in this table represents a unique invoice. The approval process for each invoice can go through multiple iterations, as indicated by the `APPROVAL_ITERATION` field. The `WFAPPROVAL_STATUS` field suggests that the approval process is likely managed through a workflow system. The `QUICK_CREDIT` field suggests that some invoices may have a quick credit feature enabled, which could potentially expedite the payment process.

14. LEGAL_ENTITY_ID: This field stores the ID of the legal entity associated with the invoice.

15. HISTORICAL_FLAG: This field is likely used to indicate whether the invoice is historical.

16. FORCE_REVALIDATION_FLAG: This field is likely used to indicate whether the invoice requires revalidation.

17. BANK_CHARGE_BEARER: This field likely indicates who bears any bank charges associated with the invoice.

18. REMITTANCE_MESSAGE1, REMITTANCE_MESSAGE2, REMITTANCE_MESSAGE3: These fields likely store messages related to the remittance of the invoice.

Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:

The LEGAL_ENTITY_ID likely links to a table containing details about the legal entities. The TAX_RELATED_INVOICE_ID may link to another invoice in the same or a different table. The various tax fields suggest that the table is used in calculating and tracking tax amounts for invoices. The presence of fields for supplier tax invoice details suggests that this table might be used in conjunction with supplier data. The FORCE_REVALIDATION_FLAG might be used to trigger certain business processes, such as revalidation of the invoice.
