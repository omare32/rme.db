Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table in the Oracle ERP system contains detailed information about all invoices in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table serves as a central repository for invoice data, which is essential for financial reporting, auditing, and accounts payable management. 

Column Descriptions:

1. INVOICE_ID: A unique identifier for each invoice. This is likely the primary key for the table.

2. LAST_UPDATE_DATE: The date and time when the invoice record was last updated.

3. LAST_UPDATED_BY: The ID of the user who last updated the invoice record.

4. VENDOR_ID: A unique identifier for the vendor associated with the invoice.

5. INVOICE_NUM: The number of the invoice as provided by the vendor.

6. SET_OF_BOOKS_ID: An identifier for the set of financial books to which the invoice belongs. This could be used for segregating financial data.

7. INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE: The currency code in which the invoice amount is denominated.

8. PAYMENT_CURRENCY_CODE: The currency code in which the payment for the invoice is made.

9. PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE: The exchange rate used for converting the invoice amount from the invoice currency to the payment currency.

10. INVOICE_AMOUNT: The total amount of the invoice in the invoice currency.

11. VENDOR_SITE_ID: A unique identifier for the vendor's location.

12. AMOUNT_PAID: The amount that has been paid towards the invoice in the payment currency.

13. DISCOUNT_AMOUNT_TAKEN: The amount of discount taken on the invoice.

14. INVOICE_DATE: The date when the invoice was issued.

15. SOURCE: The source from which the invoice was entered into the system (e.g., Manual Invoice Entry, SelfService, WORK_CONFRIMATION).

16. INVOICE_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE: The type of the invoice (e.g., STANDARD, PREPAYMENT, EXPENSE REPORT).

17. DESCRIPTION: A description of the invoice.

18. BATCH_ID: An identifier for the batch in which the invoice was processed.

19. AMOUNT_APPLICABLE_TO_DISCOUNT: The amount of the invoice that is eligible for a discount.

20. TAX_AMOUNT: The amount of tax included in the invoice.

Relationships and Business Logic:

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table likely has relationships with other tables in the ERP system. For example, the VENDOR_ID and VENDOR_SITE_ID fields could link to a vendors table that contains detailed information about each vendor. The SET_OF_BOOKS_ID could link to a financial books table. The LAST_UPDATED_BY field could link to a users table that contains information about system users.

The table appears to support multiple currencies, as indicated by the INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE and PAYMENT_CURRENCY_CODE fields. The PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE field is used to convert between these currencies.

The table also supports various types of invoices, as indicated by the INVOICE_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE field. This could influence the business logic for processing payments and discounts. For example, prepayment invoices might be handled differently than standard invoices.

Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object is a table in an Oracle ERP system that contains information related to invoices. This table is part of the Accounts Payable (AP) module and is used to store all invoice data. The data stored in this table is used for invoice processing and payment, financial reporting, and audit purposes.

Column Descriptions:

1. EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE: This field represents the type of exchange rate used for the invoice. It could be corporate, spot, or user. The sample data shows 'None' and 'Corporate' as values.

2. EXCHANGE_DATE: This field represents the date when the exchange rate was applied. It is likely in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.

3. EARLIEST_SETTLEMENT_DATE: This field represents the earliest possible date that the invoice could be settled or paid. It is also likely in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.

4. ORIGINAL_PREPAYMENT_AMOUNT: This field represents the original prepayment amount for the invoice. Prepayment is an amount paid in advance before receiving the goods or services.

5. DOC_SEQUENCE_ID: This field represents the unique identifier for the document sequence. It is used to track the sequence of documents.

6. DOC_SEQUENCE_VALUE: This field represents the value of the document in the sequence.

7. DOC_CATEGORY_CODE: This field represents the category of the document. The sample data shows categories like 'RME_SUPCONTRACTORS', 'RME_SUPPLIERS', 'STD INV', 'ADJUST INV', and 'EXP REP INV'.

8. ATTRIBUTE1 to ATTRIBUTE13: These fields are likely to be customizable fields that can be used to store additional information as per the business requirements. The actual meaning of these fields would depend on the business context. For example, ATTRIBUTE1 might be used to store a specific code, ATTRIBUTE2 might be used to store a numeric value, and ATTRIBUTE10 might be used to store a description.

Based on the sample data, it can be inferred that the table is used to store various types of invoices, including standard invoices, adjustment invoices, and expense report invoices. The table also seems to handle multiple currencies, as indicated by the exchange rate fields. The ATTRIBUTE fields suggest that the table is customizable to handle various additional business needs.

# AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL Table Documentation

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table in the Oracle ERP system is a comprehensive table that stores all invoice data. The primary business purpose of this table is to track and manage invoice information, including approval status, posting status, cancellation details, and related project accounting context. This table is crucial for financial management, accounts payable, and project accounting functions.

## Column Descriptions

1. **ATTRIBUTE14, ATTRIBUTE15**: These are generic attribute fields that can be used to store additional invoice-related information as needed by the business. The specific use of these fields can vary based on the business requirements.

2. **ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY**: This field is used to categorize the additional attributes (ATTRIBUTE14, ATTRIBUTE15) if used.

3. **APPROVAL_STATUS, APPROVAL_DESCRIPTION**: These fields are used to track the approval status of the invoice and provide a description of the approval status respectively.

4. **INVOICE_DISTRIBUTION_TOTAL**: This field represents the total amount distributed across different accounts or cost centers for the invoice.

5. **POSTING_STATUS**: This field indicates the posting status of the invoice in the general ledger.

6. **PREPAY_FLAG**: This field indicates whether the invoice is a prepayment invoice (Y) or not (N).

7. **AUTHORIZED_BY**: This field stores the name of the person who authorized the invoice.

8. **CANCELLED_DATE, CANCELLED_BY, CANCELLED_AMOUNT, TEMP_CANCELLED_AMOUNT**: These fields store information related to invoice cancellation, including the cancellation date, the person who cancelled the invoice, the amount cancelled, and a temporary field for the cancelled amount.

9. **PROJECT_ACCOUNTING_CONTEXT, USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE, USSGL_TRX_CODE_CONTEXT, PROJECT_ID, TASK_ID, EXPENDITURE_TYPE, EXPENDITURE_ITEM_DATE**: These fields are related to project accounting. They store information about the project and task associated with the invoice, the type of expenditure, the date of the expenditure item, and the USSGL (United States Standard General Ledger) transaction code and context.

## Relationships and Business Logic

The table appears to be a standalone table with no explicit relationships indicated in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that there may be relationships with other tables in the ERP system, such as a projects table (via PROJECT_ID), a tasks table (via TASK_ID), or a general ledger table (via USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE).

The business logic can be inferred from the approval and posting status fields, which likely follow a workflow from invoice creation, through approval, to posting in the general ledger. The cancellation fields suggest that there is a process for cancelling invoices, and the project accounting fields indicate that invoices can be linked to specific projects and tasks.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Description:** The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is a table that stores invoice data related to accounts payable. It is used to manage and track all the invoices from vendors, including the payment details, withholding tax information, and other related attributes. This table is crucial for financial and accounting operations, as it provides detailed information about the company's liabilities.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `PA_QUANTITY`: This field is likely to represent the quantity of a particular item or service mentioned in the invoice. The data type appears to be numeric, but the sample data does not provide any values.

2. `EXPENDITURE_ORGANIZATION_ID`: This field is likely to represent the unique identifier of the organization where the expenditure occurred. The sample data does not provide any values.

3. `PA_DEFAULT_DIST_CCID`: This field is likely to represent a default distribution cost center ID. The sample data does not provide any values.

4. `VENDOR_PREPAY_AMOUNT`: This field represents the amount prepaid to the vendor. It is a numeric field and can contain decimal values.

5. `PAYMENT_AMOUNT_TOTAL`: This field represents the total amount of the payment made for the invoice. The data type appears to be numeric, but the sample data does not provide any values.

6. `AWT_FLAG`: This field is likely to indicate whether Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT) is applicable or not. 'Y' probably indicates that AWT is applicable.

7. `AWT_GROUP_ID`: This field is likely to represent the group ID related to the Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT). It is a numeric field.

8. `REFERENCE_1` and `REFERENCE_2`: These fields are likely to contain additional reference information related to the invoice. The sample data does not provide any values.

9. `ORG_ID`: This field represents the unique identifier of the organization. It is a numeric field.

10. `PRE_WITHHOLDING_AMOUNT`: This field represents the amount withheld prior to the payment. The data type appears to be numeric, but the sample data does not provide any values.

11. `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY` and `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1` to `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE8`: These fields are likely to contain additional global attributes related to the invoice. These could be used to store customizable data as per the business needs. The sample data does not provide any values.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that each row in this table represents an invoice. The `ORG_ID` can be used to link this table with other tables containing organization details. Similarly, `EXPENDITURE_ORGANIZATION_ID` can be used to link expenditure details. The `AWT_FLAG` and `AWT_GROUP_ID` fields are likely related, with the flag indicating the applicability of AWT and the group ID providing more details about the AWT. The `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE` fields suggest that this table can be customized to store additional information as per the business needs.

Object: AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL object is a table in the Oracle ERP system that stores invoice data. This table is part of the Accounts Payable module and is used to record and manage all the invoices generated by the organization. The table contains various attributes related to the invoices, including global attributes, tax calculation flags, payment cross rate information, and multi-reporting currency (MRC) details.

Column Descriptions:

1. GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE9 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20: These columns are placeholders for storing additional attributes related to the invoice. The specific usage of these columns may vary depending on the organization's business needs. In the provided sample data, these columns do not contain any values.

2. AUTO_TAX_CALC_FLAG: This column indicates whether the tax for the invoice is calculated automatically. The specific values this column can take are not provided in the sample data.

3. PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE_TYPE: This column indicates the type of cross rate used for the payment. Cross rates are used when the invoice and payment currencies are different. The specific values this column can take are not provided in the sample data.

4. PAYMENT_CROSS_RATE_DATE: This column records the date when the cross rate for the payment was determined.

5. PAY_CURR_INVOICE_AMOUNT: This column records the amount of the invoice in the payment currency.

6. MRC_BASE_AMOUNT: This column records the base amount for multi-reporting currency (MRC). MRC is a feature in Oracle ERP that allows reporting in multiple currencies.

7. MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE: This column records the exchange rate used for MRC.

8. MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE: This column indicates the type of exchange rate used for MRC. The specific values this column can take are not provided in the sample data.

9. MRC_EXCHANGE_DATE: This column records the date when the MRC exchange rate was determined.

Based on the sample data, it appears that not all columns are used in every record. For instance, the MRC columns and the global attribute columns do not contain any values in the provided sample data. This suggests that these features may not be used by the organization, or they may only be used under certain conditions.

# AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL Table Documentation

## Overview
The `AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL` table in the Oracle ERP system is a comprehensive table that stores all invoice-related data. This table is crucial for managing and tracking all the invoices within the organization. It includes details such as the date of the invoice, approval status, amount due, and other related information. 

## Column Descriptions

1. `GL_DATE`: This field represents the General Ledger date associated with the invoice. It is the date when the invoice is recorded in the general ledger.

2. `AWARD_ID`: This field is likely to store the unique identifier of the award associated with the invoice, if any.

3. `PAID_ON_BEHALF_EMPLOYEE_ID`: This field is likely to store the unique identifier of the employee on whose behalf the payment is made.

4. `AMT_DUE_CCARD_COMPANY`: This field represents the amount due to the credit card company.

5. `AMT_DUE_EMPLOYEE`: This field represents the amount due to the employee.

6. `APPROVAL_READY_FLAG`: This field indicates whether the invoice is ready for approval. 'Y' means it is ready for approval, and 'N' means it is not.

7. `APPROVAL_ITERATION`: This field likely represents the number of iterations the invoice has gone through the approval process.

8. `WFAPPROVAL_STATUS`: This field represents the status of the workflow approval for the invoice.

9. `REQUESTER_ID`: This field likely stores the unique identifier of the employee who requested the invoice.

10. `VALIDATION_REQUEST_ID`: This field likely stores the unique identifier of the validation request associated with the invoice.

11. `VALIDATED_TAX_AMOUNT`: This field represents the amount of tax validated for the invoice.

12. `QUICK_CREDIT`: This field indicates whether the invoice has a quick credit feature enabled. 'Y' means it is enabled, and 'N' means it is not.

13. `CREDITED_INVOICE_ID`: This field likely stores the unique identifier of the credited invoice, if any.

14. `DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID`: This field likely stores the unique identifier of the distribution set associated with the invoice.

15. `APPLICATION_ID`: This field likely stores the unique identifier of the application where the invoice was created.

16. `PRODUCT_TABLE`: This field likely stores the name of the product table associated with the invoice.

17. `REFERENCE_KEY1`, `REFERENCE_KEY2`, `REFERENCE_KEY3`, `REFERENCE_KEY4`: These fields are likely used to store additional reference information related to the invoice.

## Relationships and Business Logic

The `AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL` table likely has relationships with other tables in the ERP system. For example, the `AWARD_ID` might link to an Awards table, `PAID_ON_BEHALF_EMPLOYEE_ID` and `REQUESTER_ID` might link to an Employees table, and `APPLICATION_ID` might link to an Applications table.

The `APPROVAL_READY_FLAG` and `WFAPPROVAL_STATUS` fields suggest that there is a business process for approving invoices. The `APPROVAL_ITERATION` field might be used to track how many times an invoice has been sent back for revisions before approval.

The `VALIDATED_TAX_AMOUNT` field suggests that there is a tax validation process for invoices. The `QUICK_CREDIT` field suggests that some invoices might have a quick credit feature enabled.

## AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL Table Documentation

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table is a part of the Oracle ERP system. This table is used to store detailed information about the invoices generated in the system. It includes data about the payment method, the party involved, the amount, and other related details. This information is crucial for financial tracking, auditing, and reporting purposes.

Below is a detailed description of each field in the table:

1. **UNIQUE_REMITTANCE_IDENTIFIER**: This field is intended to store a unique identifier for the remittance. However, based on the sample data, it appears to be null in all cases.

2. **URI_CHECK_DIGIT**: This field is supposed to contain a check digit for the unique remittance identifier. It is also null in the sample data.

3. **SETTLEMENT_PRIORITY**: This field is meant to store the priority of the settlement. It is currently null in the sample data.

4. **PAYMENT_REASON_CODE**: This field is intended to store a code representing the reason for the payment. It is null in the sample data.

5. **PAYMENT_REASON_COMMENTS**: This field is meant to store any comments related to the reason for the payment. It is also null in the sample data.

6. **PAYMENT_METHOD_CODE**: This field stores the code of the payment method used. It can be EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer), CHECK, Bank_Transfer, or Cash.

7. **DELIVERY_CHANNEL_CODE**: This field is intended to store the code of the delivery channel. It is null in the sample data.

8. **QUICK_PO_HEADER_ID**: This field stores the ID of the Purchase Order header.

9. **NET_OF_RETAINAGE_FLAG**: This field indicates whether the amount is net of retainage. It is a flag field that can be 'Y' for Yes or 'N' for No.

10. **RELEASE_AMOUNT_NET_OF_TAX**: This field is intended to store the release amount net of tax. It is null in the sample data.

11. **CONTROL_AMOUNT**: This field is meant to store the control amount. It is null in the sample data.

12. **PARTY_ID**: This field stores the ID of the party involved in the transaction.

13. **PARTY_SITE_ID**: This field stores the ID of the party site.

14. **PAY_PROC_TRXN_TYPE_CODE**: This field stores the code of the transaction type in the payables process.

15. **PAYMENT_FUNCTION**: This field stores the function of the payment. It can be 'PAYABLES_DISB' or other types.

16. **CUST_REGISTRATION_CODE**: This field is intended to store the customer registration code. It is null in the sample data.

17. **CUST_REGISTRATION_NUMBER**: This field is intended to store the customer registration number. It is null in the sample data.

18. **PORT_OF_ENTRY_CODE**: This field is intended to store the code of the port of entry. It is null in the sample data.

19. **EXTERNAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID**: This field stores the ID of the external bank account.

20. **VENDOR_CONTACT_ID**: This field is intended to store the ID of the vendor contact. It is null in the sample data.

Based on the data, it can be inferred that this table is related to other tables in the system through fields like PARTY_ID, PARTY_SITE_ID, QUICK_PO_HEADER_ID, and EXTERNAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID. These fields likely serve as foreign keys linking to other tables containing detailed information about the parties, purchase orders, and bank accounts.
