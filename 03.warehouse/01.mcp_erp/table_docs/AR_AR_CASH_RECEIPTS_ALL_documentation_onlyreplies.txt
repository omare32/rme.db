Object Name: AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL

The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL is a table in the Oracle ERP system. This table is part of the Accounts Receivable (AR) module and is used to store all the information related to cash receipts. The purpose of this table is to track and manage all cash receipts, which are payments received by the company from its customers.

This is the seventh group of columns in the AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL table. The columns in this group are:

1. WORK_ITEM_EXCEPTION_REASON: This column is designed to store any exceptions or issues that occurred during the processing of a work item. An exception could be any event that interrupts the normal flow of processing, such as an error or a failure. The data type of this column is text. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which indicates that there were no exceptions during the processing of these work items.

2. AUTOMATCH_SET_ID: This column is intended to store the identification number of the set of rules used for automatic matching. Automatic matching is a feature that matches transactions based on certain criteria, such as the amount, date, or reference number. The data type of this column is numeric. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which suggests that automatic matching was not used for these transactions.

3. AUTOAPPLY_FLAG: This column is used to indicate whether the auto-apply feature was used for a transaction. The auto-apply feature automatically applies a receipt to an open transaction when the receipt is saved. The data type of this column is character, with 'Y' indicating that auto-apply was used and 'N' indicating that it was not. In the provided sample data, most values are None, with one row having a value of 'N', indicating that auto-apply was not used for that transaction.

4. SEQ_TYPE_LAST: This column is designed to store the last sequence type used for a transaction. The sequence type is a parameter that determines the order in which transactions are processed. The data type of this column is text. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which suggests that the sequence type was not specified for these transactions.

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that this table is used to track the processing of cash receipts, including any exceptions that occur, the use of automatic matching and auto-apply, and the sequence type used. However, the sample data does not provide any specific examples of these features being used.
