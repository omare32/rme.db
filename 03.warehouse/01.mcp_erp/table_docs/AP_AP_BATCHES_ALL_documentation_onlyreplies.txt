**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The `BATCH_ID` is likely the primary key for this table and could be used to link to other tables or views in the database that contain batch-related information.

The `LAST_UPDATED_BY` and `CREATED_BY` fields likely relate to a user table in the database, allowing for tracking of who is making changes to the batch records.

The `CONTROL_INVOICE_COUNT` and `ACTUAL_INVOICE_COUNT`, as well as `CONTROL_INVOICE_TOTAL` and `ACTUAL_INVOICE_TOTAL`, are likely used for reconciliation purposes, ensuring that the batch contains the expected number and total amount of invoices.

The `PAY_GROUP_LOOKUP_CODE`, `BATCH_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`, and `TERMS_ID` fields likely relate to other tables or views in the database that contain additional information about payment groups, batch code combinations, and payment terms, respectively.
