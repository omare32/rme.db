Object Name: AP.AP_SUPPLIERS

The AP.AP_SUPPLIERS table in the Oracle ERP system contains information about the suppliers that a company interacts with. This table serves a crucial role in the Accounts Payable (AP) module, storing data related to vendor identification, creation and update details, vendor type, and other vendor-specific attributes. 

Column Descriptions:

1. VENDOR_ID: A unique identifier for each vendor. This is likely the primary key for the table.

2. LAST_UPDATE_DATE: The date and time when the vendor's record was last updated.

3. LAST_UPDATED_BY: The ID of the user who last updated the vendor's record.

4. VENDOR_NAME: The official name of the vendor.

5. VENDOR_NAME_ALT: An alternate name for the vendor, if any.

6. SEGMENT1: This appears to be a unique identifier or code for the vendor. The purpose and usage of this field are not clear from the sample data and might be specific to the business context.

7. SUMMARY_FLAG: A flag indicating whether the record is a summary record. 'N' likely means it is not a summary record, while 'Y' would indicate it is.

8. ENABLED_FLAG: A flag indicating whether the vendor is currently active or inactive. 'Y' likely means the vendor is active, while 'N' would indicate the vendor is inactive.

9. SEGMENT2, SEGMENT3, SEGMENT4, SEGMENT5: These fields are currently empty in the sample data. They may be used for additional vendor information or categorization based on business-specific needs.

10. LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN: The login ID of the user who last updated the record.

11. CREATION_DATE: The date and time when the vendor's record was created.

12. CREATED_BY: The ID of the user who created the vendor's record.

13. EMPLOYEE_ID: This field is currently empty in the sample data. It may be used to link the vendor to a specific employee, such as a contact person or account manager.

14. VENDOR_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE: This field may be used to categorize vendors based on their type. The specific codes used would depend on the business context.

15. CUSTOMER_NUM: This field is currently empty in the sample data. It may be used to link the vendor to a customer number, perhaps indicating a vendor that is also a customer.

16. ONE_TIME_FLAG: A flag indicating whether the vendor is a one-time vendor. 'N' likely means the vendor is not a one-time vendor, while 'Y' would indicate it is.

17. PARENT_VENDOR_ID: This field is currently empty in the sample data. It may be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship between vendors, such as a parent company and its subsidiaries.

Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:

The VENDOR_ID field is likely the primary key and may be used to link this table to other tables in the database. The LAST_UPDATED_BY, CREATED_BY, and LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN fields suggest that this table is linked to a user or employee table in the database. The EMPLOYEE_ID, if used, would also link to an employee table. The VENDOR_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE could link to a lookup table containing vendor type definitions. The PARENT_VENDOR_ID suggests a self-referential relationship, where a vendor can be related to another vendor.

16. PAYMENT_CURRENCY_CODE: This field represents the code of the currency in which payments are made to the supplier. 'EGP' (Egyptian Pound) is one of the values in the sample data.

17. INVOICE_AMOUNT_LIMIT: This field represents the maximum invoice amount limit for the supplier. It is currently empty in the provided sample data.

18. EXCHANGE_DATE_LOOKUP_CODE: This field represents the code that indicates the date of the exchange rate to be used for currency conversion. It is currently empty in the provided sample data.

19. HOLD_ALL_PAYMENTS_FLAG: This field indicates whether all payments to the supplier are on hold. 'N' means No.

20. HOLD_FUTURE_PAYMENTS_FLAG: This field indicates whether future payments to the supplier are on hold. 'N' means No.

The relationships between these fields and other tables in the database would depend on the overall database design and business rules. However, it can be inferred that fields like SHIP_TO_LOCATION_ID, BILL_TO_LOCATION_ID, TERMS_ID, and SET_OF_BOOKS_ID would likely link to other tables containing detailed information about these entities.

Object Name: AP.AP_SUPPLIERS

The AP.AP_SUPPLIERS table in the Oracle ERP system is designed to store information related to suppliers. This table is crucial for managing supplier data, including their payment methods, bank account details, tax information, and other related attributes. It is used in various business processes such as procurement, accounts payable, and financial reporting.

Column Descriptions:

1. HOLD_REASON: This field is likely to store the reason why a supplier might be put on hold. The sample data does not provide any values, suggesting that none of the suppliers in the sample are currently on hold.

2. DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the distribution set associated with the supplier. Distribution sets are used to automatically distribute invoice amounts across multiple accounts.

3. ACCTS_PAY_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the account code combination used for accounts payable for the supplier.

4. DISC_LOST_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the account code combination used when a discount is lost.

5. DISC_TAKEN_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the account code combination used when a discount is taken.

6. EXPENSE_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the account code combination used for expenses related to the supplier.

7. PREPAY_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier for the account code combination used for prepayments to the supplier.

8. NUM_1099: This field is likely to store the 1099 number for the supplier, which is used for tax reporting purposes in the United States.

9. TYPE_1099: This field is likely to store the type of 1099 form associated with the supplier.

10. WITHHOLDING_STATUS_LOOKUP_CODE: This field is likely to store the code representing the withholding status of the supplier.

11. WITHHOLDING_START_DATE: This field is likely to store the date when withholding started for the supplier.

12. ORGANIZATION_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE: This field is likely to store the code representing the type of organization of the supplier.

13. VAT_CODE: This field is likely to store the VAT (Value Added Tax) code associated with the supplier.

14. START_DATE_ACTIVE: This field stores the date from which the supplier became active.

15. END_DATE_ACTIVE: This field stores the date till which the supplier was active.

16. MINORITY_GROUP_LOOKUP_CODE: This field is likely to store the code representing the minority group of the supplier, if applicable.

17. PAYMENT_METHOD_LOOKUP_CODE: This field is likely to store the code representing the payment method used for the supplier.

18. BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME: This field stores the name of the bank account of the supplier.

19. BANK_ACCOUNT_NUM: This field stores the bank account number of the supplier.

20. BANK_NUM: This field stores the bank number of the supplier's bank.

The relationships or business logic cannot be inferred from the provided data alone. However, it can be assumed that this table might be linked to other tables in the ERP system via fields like DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID, ACCTS_PAY_CODE_COMBINATION_ID, and other similar fields.

Object Name: AP.AP_SUPPLIERS

The AP.AP_SUPPLIERS object is a table in an Oracle ERP system that contains information about the suppliers in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table is used to store various attributes related to suppliers, including their bank account type, ownership details, industry classification, hold status, terms and conditions, and receipt requirements. This information is crucial for managing supplier relationships, processing payments, and ensuring compliance with business rules and regulations.

Column Descriptions:

1. BANK_ACCOUNT_TYPE: This field indicates the type of bank account associated with the supplier. The data type is not specified in the sample data.

2. WOMEN_OWNED_FLAG: This is a flag indicating whether the supplier is women-owned. 'N' suggests that the supplier is not women-owned.

3. SMALL_BUSINESS_FLAG: This is a flag indicating whether the supplier is a small business. 'N' suggests that the supplier is not a small business.

4. STANDARD_INDUSTRY_CLASS: This field represents the standard industry classification of the supplier. The data type is not specified in the sample data.

5. HOLD_FLAG: This flag indicates whether there is a hold on the supplier's account. 'N' suggests that there is no hold.

6. PURCHASING_HOLD_REASON: This field provides the reason for any purchasing hold on the supplier's account.

7. HOLD_BY: This field indicates who placed the hold on the supplier's account.

8. HOLD_DATE: This field records the date when the hold was placed on the supplier's account.

9. TERMS_DATE_BASIS: This field indicates the basis for the terms date. In the sample data, it is set to 'Invoice'.

10. PRICE_TOLERANCE: This field represents the price tolerance level for the supplier's products or services.

11. INSPECTION_REQUIRED_FLAG: This flag indicates whether inspection is required for the supplier's products or services.

12. RECEIPT_REQUIRED_FLAG: This flag indicates whether a receipt is required from the supplier.

13. QTY_RCV_TOLERANCE: This field represents the quantity received tolerance level for the supplier's products or services.

14. QTY_RCV_EXCEPTION_CODE: This field records the exception code related to the quantity received from the supplier.

15. ENFORCE_SHIP_TO_LOCATION_CODE: This field indicates the code for the enforced shipping location.

16. DAYS_EARLY_RECEIPT_ALLOWED: This field represents the number of days early a receipt is allowed from the supplier.

17. DAYS_LATE_RECEIPT_ALLOWED: This field represents the number of days late a receipt is allowed from the supplier.

18. RECEIPT_DAYS_EXCEPTION_CODE: This field records the exception code related to the receipt days from the supplier.

19. RECEIVING_ROUTING_ID: This field indicates the ID for the receiving routing.

20. ALLOW_SUBSTITUTE_RECEIPTS_FLAG: This flag indicates whether substitute receipts are allowed from the supplier.

The relationships or business logic among these fields are not explicitly provided in the data. However, fields such as HOLD_FLAG, PURCHASING_HOLD_REASON, HOLD_BY, and HOLD_DATE are likely related and used together to manage holds on supplier accounts. Similarly, fields related to receipt requirements and tolerances (e.g., RECEIPT_REQUIRED_FLAG, QTY_RCV_TOLERANCE, DAYS_EARLY_RECEIPT_ALLOWED, DAYS_LATE_RECEIPT_ALLOWED) are probably used together to manage the receipt of goods or services from suppliers.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `ALLOW_UNORDERED_RECEIPTS_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether unordered receipts are allowed for the supplier. If the value is 'Y', unordered receipts are allowed. If 'N', they are not allowed.

2. `HOLD_UNMATCHED_INVOICES_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether unmatched invoices from the supplier should be held. If 'Y', unmatched invoices are held. If 'N', they are not held.

3. `EXCLUSIVE_PAYMENT_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether the supplier is set up for exclusive payment. The exact meaning of this flag may vary depending on the business context.

4. `AP_TAX_ROUNDING_RULE`: This field specifies the tax rounding rule applied to the supplier's invoices.

5. `AUTO_TAX_CALC_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether tax for the supplier's invoices is calculated automatically. If 'Y', tax is calculated automatically. If 'N', it is not.

6. `AUTO_TAX_CALC_OVERRIDE`: This field indicates whether the automatic tax calculation can be overridden.

7. `AMOUNT_INCLUDES_TAX_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether the amount on the supplier's invoices includes tax. If 'Y', the amount includes tax. If 'N', it does not.

8. `TAX_VERIFICATION_DATE`: This field stores the date when the supplier's tax information was last verified.

9. `NAME_CONTROL`: This field may be used to store a control name or code for the supplier.

10. `STATE_REPORTABLE_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether the supplier's transactions are reportable at the state level. If 'Y', transactions are state reportable. If 'N', they are not.

11. `FEDERAL_REPORTABLE_FLAG`: This flag indicates whether the supplier's transactions are reportable at the federal level. If 'Y', transactions are federal reportable. If 'N', they are not.

12. `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: This field is used to categorize the supplier based on certain attributes.

13. `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE8`: These fields are used to store additional attribute information about the supplier. The exact meaning of these attributes may vary depending on the business context.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

- The `ALLOW_UNORDERED_RECEIPTS_FLAG` and `HOLD_UNMATCHED_INVOICES_FLAG` fields suggest that there is a relationship between this table and the receipts and invoices tables in the database.
- The `AP_TAX_ROUNDING_RULE`, `AUTO_TAX_CALC_FLAG`, `AUTO_TAX_CALC_OVERRIDE`, `AMOUNT_INCLUDES_TAX_FLAG`, and `TAX_VERIFICATION_DATE` fields suggest that there is a relationship between this table and the tax calculation process in the system.
- The `STATE_REPORTABLE_FLAG` and `FEDERAL_REPORTABLE_FLAG` fields suggest that there is a relationship between this table and the reporting process in the system.
- The `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY` and `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE8` fields suggest that the supplier can be categorized and described in various ways based on the business context.

## AP.AP_SUPPLIERS Table Documentation (Group 7 of 9)

The AP.AP_SUPPLIERS table in the Oracle ERP system is a part of a larger database structure that is used to store and manage information related to suppliers. This particular group of columns seems to be designed to store additional attributes related to the suppliers. However, based on the provided sample data, it appears that these fields are not currently being used.

### Column Descriptions:

1. **AWT_GROUP_ID**: This field is likely intended to store the ID of the withholding tax group that the supplier belongs to. Withholding tax groups are typically used to group suppliers that are subject to the same withholding tax rules. However, in the provided sample data, this field is not being used.

2. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE19**: These fields are likely intended to store additional, customizable attributes related to the supplier. The purpose of these fields can vary depending on the specific needs of the business. For example, they could be used to store information such as the supplier's industry, the region they operate in, or their preferred method of payment. However, in the provided sample data, these fields are not being used.

### Relationships and Business Logic:

Without more context or data, it's difficult to infer any relationships or business logic. However, typically in an ERP system, the AP.AP_SUPPLIERS table would be related to other tables in the database. For example, there could be relationships between this table and tables that store information about purchase orders, invoices, or payments.

The AWT_GROUP_ID field suggests that there might be a relationship between this table and a table that stores information about withholding tax groups. The supplier's withholding tax group could potentially impact the calculation of taxes on payments made to the supplier.

The GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields suggest that this table could be customized to store a wide variety of additional information about suppliers, depending on the specific needs of the business. This could potentially impact various business processes, such as supplier selection or payment processing.

9. BANK_BRANCH_TYPE: This field is intended to store information about the type of bank branch associated with the supplier.

10. MATCH_OPTION: This field stores the match option for the supplier. The sample data shows 'R', but without further context, the meaning of 'R' is unclear.

11. FUTURE_DATED_PAYMENT_CCID: This field is intended to store information related to future-dated payments for the supplier.

12. CREATE_DEBIT_MEMO_FLAG: This field is a flag that indicates whether a debit memo should be created for the supplier. A 'Y' indicates that a debit memo should be created.

13. OFFSET_TAX_FLAG: This field is a flag that indicates whether tax should be offset for the supplier.

14. PARTY_ID: This field stores the unique identifier for the supplier.

15. PARENT_PARTY_ID: This field stores the unique identifier of the parent party of the supplier, if any.

16. NI_NUMBER: This field is intended to store the National Insurance number of the supplier.

17. TCA_SYNC_NUM_1099: This field is intended to store the 1099 number of the supplier for TCA synchronization.

18. TCA_SYNC_VENDOR_NAME: This field stores the name of the supplier for TCA synchronization.

19. TCA_SYNC_VAT_REG_NUM: This field stores the VAT registration number of the supplier for TCA synchronization.

20. INDIVIDUAL_1099: This field is intended to store information related to individual 1099 for the supplier.

The relationships or business logic cannot be inferred without more context or access to other related tables in the database. However, it is clear that this table is crucial for managing supplier data, which is essential for procurement, accounts payable, and supply chain management processes.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_SUPPLIERS

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AP.AP_SUPPLIERS object in the Oracle ERP system is designed to store detailed information about suppliers. This information is crucial for managing supplier relationships, tracking supplier performance, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. 

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `UNIQUE_TAX_REFERENCE_NUM`: This field is likely to store the unique tax reference number for each supplier. This number is typically used for tax purposes.

2. `PARTNERSHIP_UTR`: This field is likely to store the unique tax reference number for a partnership, if the supplier is part of a partnership.

3. `PARTNERSHIP_NAME`: This field is likely to store the name of the partnership, if the supplier is part of a partnership.

4. `CIS_ENABLED_FLAG`: This field is likely to indicate whether the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) is enabled for the supplier. 

5. `FIRST_NAME`: This field is likely to store the first name of the supplier contact.

6. `SECOND_NAME`: This field is likely to store the middle name of the supplier contact.

7. `LAST_NAME`: This field is likely to store the last name of the supplier contact.

8. `SALUTATION`: This field is likely to store the salutation (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Dr.) for the supplier contact.

9. `TRADING_NAME`: This field is likely to store the trading name of the supplier.

10. `WORK_REFERENCE`: This field is likely to store a work reference number or code for the supplier.

11. `COMPANY_REGISTRATION_NUMBER`: This field is likely to store the company registration number of the supplier.

12. `NATIONAL_INSURANCE_NUMBER`: This field is likely to store the national insurance number of the supplier contact.

13. `VERIFICATION_NUMBER`: This field is likely to store a verification number associated with the supplier.

14. `VERIFICATION_REQUEST_ID`: This field is likely to store the ID of a verification request associated with the supplier.

15. `MATCH_STATUS_FLAG`: This field is likely to indicate the status of a match operation, such as a data matching or verification process.

16. `CIS_VERIFICATION_DATE`: This field is likely to store the date when the CIS verification was performed for the supplier.

17. `PAY_AWT_GROUP_ID`: This field is likely to store the ID of a payment group associated with the supplier.

18. `CIS_PARENT_VENDOR_ID`: This field is likely to store the ID of a parent vendor in the CIS, if the supplier is part of a larger vendor group.

19. `BUS_CLASS_LAST_CERTIFIED_DATE`: This field is likely to store the date when the supplier's business classification was last certified.

20. `BUS_CLASS_LAST_CERTIFIED_BY`: This field is likely to store the name or ID of the person or entity that last certified the supplier's business classification.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The `CIS_ENABLED_FLAG`, `CIS_VERIFICATION_DATE`, and `CIS_PARENT_VENDOR_ID` fields suggest that this table is used in conjunction with the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). This implies that the table may be used to manage suppliers in the construction industry.

The `PAY_AWT_GROUP_ID` field suggests that suppliers may be grouped for payment purposes. This could be used to manage payment schedules or terms.

The `BUS_CLASS_LAST_CERTIFIED_DATE` and `BUS_CLASS_LAST_CERTIFIED_BY` fields suggest that the business classification of suppliers is periodically reviewed and certified. This could be part of a compliance or risk management process.
