**Object Name:** AR.AR_RECEIPT_CLASSES

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AR.AR_RECEIPT_CLASSES object in the Oracle ERP system contains information about different classes of receipts in the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. It is used to manage and track the various types of receipts, their creation methods, statuses, and other related attributes. This information is crucial for financial reporting, auditing, and managing cash flows.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `RECEIPT_CLASS_ID`: This is a unique identifier for each receipt class. It is a numerical value and is used to differentiate between various receipt classes.

2. `CONFIRM_FLAG`: This is a flag indicating whether the receipt class has been confirmed. It is a character field with 'Y' indicating confirmation and 'N' indicating no confirmation.

3. `CREATED_BY`: This field records the user ID of the person who created the receipt class. It is a numerical value.

4. `CREATION_DATE`: This timestamp field records the date and time when the receipt class was created.

5. `CREATION_METHOD_CODE`: This field indicates the method used to create the receipt class. Examples include 'MANUAL' and 'NETTING'.

6. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: This field records the user ID of the person who last updated the receipt class. It is a numerical value.

7. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: This timestamp field records the date and time when the receipt class was last updated.

8. `CLEAR_FLAG`: This is a flag indicating whether the receipt class has been cleared. It is a character field with 'Y' indicating cleared and 'N' indicating not cleared.

9. `NAME`: This field contains the name of the receipt class. It is a string value.

10. `REMIT_FLAG`: This is a flag indicating whether the receipt class is remitted. It is a character field with 'Y' indicating remitted and 'N' indicating not remitted.

11. `CREATION_STATUS`: This field indicates the status of the receipt class creation. Examples include 'CLEARED', 'REMITTED', and 'CONFIRMED'.

12. `LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN`: This field records the login ID of the user who last updated the receipt class. It is a numerical value.

13. `REMIT_METHOD_CODE`: This field indicates the method used for remittance. It could be 'STANDARD' or other methods.

14. `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: This field is reserved for future use to categorize the attributes.

15. `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE6`: These fields are reserved for future use to store additional information related to the receipt class.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

- The `CREATED_BY` and `LAST_UPDATED_BY` fields likely refer to user IDs in a separate Users table in the database.
- The `RECEIPT_CLASS_ID` is likely used as a foreign key in other tables to link related data.
- The `CREATION_METHOD_CODE` and `REMIT_METHOD_CODE` fields may correspond to codes defined in separate tables or lists of values.
- The `CONFIRM_FLAG`, `CLEAR_FLAG`, and `REMIT_FLAG` fields are used to track the lifecycle and status of the receipt class.
- The `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY` and `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE6` fields are placeholders for future expansion of the table structure.

Object: AR.AR_RECEIPT_CLASSES

The AR.AR_RECEIPT_CLASSES object in the Oracle ERP system is a table or view that is part of the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. This object is likely used to store additional attributes or characteristics related to receipt classes in the system. Receipt classes are used to define the payment methods for receipts, and this object seems to store additional, customizable information about these classes.

However, based on the provided sample data, it appears that these additional attributes are not currently being used, as all the values are 'None'. 

Columns:

1. ATTRIBUTE7 to ATTRIBUTE15: These columns are likely designed to store additional, customizable attributes or characteristics of the receipt classes. The specific purpose of these attributes would depend on the business's specific needs and could vary widely. However, based on the sample data, these fields are currently not in use.

2. GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE11: Similar to the ATTRIBUTE fields, these GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields are likely designed to store additional, customizable global attributes or characteristics of the receipt classes. These could be attributes that are applicable across all instances or locations of the business. Again, the specific purpose of these attributes would depend on the business's specific needs. Based on the sample data, these fields are also currently not in use.

Relationships or Business Logic:

Without more information or context, it's difficult to infer specific relationships or business logic from this object. However, given its name and the nature of its fields, it's likely that this object is related to other objects in the AR module that deal with receipts or payment methods. The ATTRIBUTE and GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields suggest that this object could be used to store additional, customizable information about receipt classes based on the specific needs of the business.
