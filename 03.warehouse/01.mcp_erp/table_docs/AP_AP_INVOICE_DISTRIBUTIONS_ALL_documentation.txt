**Object Name**: AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

**Object Type**: Table/View

**Business Purpose**: This object is used to store the distribution details of all invoices in the Accounts Payable (AP) module of the Oracle ERP system. It contains information about the accounting date, distribution line number, invoice ID, amount, and other related data. This information is crucial for tracking and managing invoice payments, accruals, and asset tracking.

**Column Descriptions**:

1. `ACCOUNTING_DATE`: The date when the accounting entry was made for the invoice. It is in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

2. `ACCRUAL_POSTED_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether the accrual for the invoice has been posted (Y) or not (N).

3. `ASSETS_ADDITION_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether the invoice includes an addition to assets (Y) or not (N). The 'U' value might indicate an unknown or undefined status.

4. `ASSETS_TRACKING_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether asset tracking is enabled (Y) or not (N) for the invoice.

5. `CASH_POSTED_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether the cash for the invoice has been posted (Y) or not (N).

6. `DISTRIBUTION_LINE_NUMBER`: The line number of the distribution in the invoice.

7. `DIST_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: The unique identifier for the distribution code combination.

8. `INVOICE_ID`: The unique identifier for the invoice.

9. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: The user ID of the person who last updated the record.

10. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: The date and time when the record was last updated.

11. `LINE_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE`: The lookup code for the type of line item in the invoice. This could include codes like 'ITEM', 'NONREC_TAX', 'AWT', 'REC_TAX', 'ACCRUAL', etc.

12. `PERIOD_NAME`: The name of the accounting period for the invoice.

13. `SET_OF_BOOKS_ID`: The unique identifier for the set of books associated with the invoice.

14. `ACCTS_PAY_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: The unique identifier for the accounts payable code combination.

15. `AMOUNT`: The total amount of the invoice.

16. `BASE_AMOUNT`: The base amount of the invoice before any additions or deductions.

17. `BASE_INVOICE_PRICE_VARIANCE`: The variance between the base amount and the invoice price.

18. `BATCH_ID`: The unique identifier for the batch of invoices.

19. `CREATED_BY`: The user ID of the person who created the record.

20. `CREATION_DATE`: The date and time when the record was created.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic**:

- The `INVOICE_ID` can be used to link this table with other invoice-related tables in the AP module.
- The `SET_OF_BOOKS_ID` can be used to link this table with the general ledger or other financial tables.
- The `CREATED_BY` and `LAST_UPDATED_BY` fields can be used to track who is creating and modifying records in this table.
- The `ACCRUAL_POSTED_FLAG`, `ASSETS_ADDITION_FLAG`, `ASSETS_TRACKING_FLAG`, and `CASH_POSTED_FLAG` fields are used to track the status of various aspects of the invoice.
- The `AMOUNT`, `BASE_AMOUNT`, and `BASE_INVOICE_PRICE_VARIANCE` fields are used to calculate the total cost of the invoice.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

- The `FINAL_MATCH_FLAG` and `MATCH_STATUS_FLAG` fields are related, as they both deal with the matching of invoices and purchase orders.
- The `PROGRAM_APPLICATION_ID`, `PROGRAM_ID`, and `PROGRAM_UPDATE_DATE` fields are related, as they all deal with the program associated with the invoice.
- The `AMOUNT_ENCUMBERED` and `BASE_AMOUNT_ENCUMBERED` fields are related, as they both deal with the amount encumbered by the invoice.
- The `EXCHANGE_RATE_VARIANCE` and `INVOICE_PRICE_VARIANCE` fields could be used to calculate the actual cost of the invoice in the local currency.
- The `REVERSAL_FLAG` field could be used to filter out reversed invoices from financial reports.
- The `POSTED_FLAG` field could be used to filter out unposted invoices from financial reports.
- The `QUANTITY_INVOICED` and `UNIT_PRICE` fields could be used to calculate the total cost of the invoice.

## AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL Table Documentation

The `AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL` table is a part of the Oracle ERP system, specifically within the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table is used to store detailed information about invoice distributions, including encumbrance, exchange rates, price adjustments, and various attributes. 

Below is a detailed explanation of each column in the table:

1. `ENCUMBERED_FLAG`: This field indicates whether the invoice distribution is encumbered. Encumbrance is an accounting practice where funds are reserved for a specific purpose. The flag 'N' indicates that the distribution is not encumbered.

2. `EXCHANGE_DATE`: This field represents the date on which the exchange rate was applied.

3. `EXCHANGE_RATE`: This field stores the exchange rate that was used for the invoice distribution.

4. `EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE`: This field indicates the type of exchange rate that was used.

5. `PRICE_ADJUSTMENT_FLAG`: This field indicates whether a price adjustment has been made.

6. `PRICE_VAR_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: This field stores the identifier for the code combination related to the price variance.

7. `QUANTITY_UNENCUMBERED`: This field represents the quantity that is not encumbered.

8. `STAT_AMOUNT`: This field stores the statistical amount for the invoice distribution.

9. `AMOUNT_TO_POST`: This field represents the amount to be posted for the invoice distribution.

10. `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE15`: These fields are generic columns that can be used to store additional information about the invoice distribution. The specific use of these fields can vary depending on the organization's needs.

The sample data provided does not contain any values, so it's not possible to infer any relationships or business logic from it. However, in a typical scenario, the `PRICE_VAR_CODE_COMBINATION_ID` could be used to join this table with other tables that contain detailed information about the code combinations. Similarly, the `ATTRIBUTE` fields could be used to store information that links the invoice distribution to other business entities or processes.

14. **PROJECT_ACCOUNTING_CONTEXT**: This column likely represents the context or details related to the project accounting.

15. **PROJECT_ID**: This column represents the ID of the project associated with the invoice.

16. **TASK_ID**: This column represents the ID of the task associated with the invoice.

## Inferred Relationships and Business Logic

The `PROJECT_ID` and `TASK_ID` columns suggest that each invoice distribution is associated with a specific project and task. The `EXPENDITURE_ORGANIZATION_ID` and `EXPENDITURE_TYPE` columns suggest that each invoice distribution is also associated with a specific expenditure, which is incurred by a particular organization and has a specific type. The `PARENT_INVOICE_ID` column suggests that there may be a hierarchical relationship between invoices. The various amount and posting columns suggest that the table plays a role in tracking the financial status of each invoice.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** This object appears to be part of an Accounts Payable (AP) system in an Oracle ERP. It likely stores detailed information about invoice distributions, including various attributes related to tax, quantity variances, and references. This data can be used for financial reporting, auditing, and analysis.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE`: This field likely represents a code related to a transaction in the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL). The USSGL provides a uniform chart of accounts and technical guidance for standardizing federal agency accounting.

2. `USSGL_TRX_CODE_CONTEXT`: This field likely provides additional context or details related to the USSGL transaction code.

3. `EARLIEST_SETTLEMENT_DATE`: This field likely represents the earliest date on which the invoice can be settled or paid.

4. `REQ_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for a specific distribution request.

5. `QUANTITY_VARIANCE`: This field likely represents the difference between the expected and actual quantity of items in the invoice.

6. `BASE_QUANTITY_VARIANCE`: This field likely represents the difference between the expected and actual quantity of base units in the invoice.

7. `PACKET_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for a packet or group of related invoices.

8. `AWT_FLAG`: This field likely indicates whether Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT) is applicable to the invoice.

9. `AWT_GROUP_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for a group of invoices subject to the same AWT.

10. `AWT_TAX_RATE_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for a specific AWT rate.

11. `AWT_GROSS_AMOUNT`: This field likely represents the gross amount of the invoice before AWT is applied.

12. `AWT_INVOICE_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for an invoice subject to AWT.

13. `AWT_ORIGIN_GROUP_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for the original group of invoices from which the current invoice was derived.

14. `REFERENCE_1` and `REFERENCE_2`: These fields likely provide additional reference information or notes related to the invoice.

15. `ORG_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for the organization associated with the invoice.

16. `OTHER_INVOICE_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for another related invoice.

17. `AWT_INVOICE_PAYMENT_ID`: This field likely represents a unique identifier for a payment made against an invoice subject to AWT.

18. `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY` and `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1`: These fields likely provide additional global attributes or characteristics related to the invoice.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

- The `AWT_FLAG`, `AWT_GROUP_ID`, `AWT_TAX_RATE_ID`, `AWT_GROSS_AMOUNT`, `AWT_INVOICE_ID`, and `AWT_INVOICE_PAYMENT_ID` fields suggest that the system supports Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT) functionality.
- The `USSGL_TRANSACTION_CODE` and `USSGL_TRX_CODE_CONTEXT` fields suggest that the system may integrate with the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) for financial reporting purposes.
- The `QUANTITY_VARIANCE` and `BASE_QUANTITY_VARIANCE` fields suggest that the system tracks discrepancies between expected and actual quantities in the invoice, which could be used for auditing or discrepancy resolution processes.
- The `ORG_ID` field suggests that the system supports multi-organization functionality, where each invoice is associated with a specific organization.
- The `OTHER_INVOICE_ID` field suggests that invoices can be related to each other, possibly for tracking purposes or to handle situations like credit memos or invoice adjustments.

Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is a table or view that is part of the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This object appears to be designed to store global attributes related to invoice distributions. However, based on the sample data provided, it is not clear what specific business purpose these global attributes serve as all the sample values are None.

Column Descriptions:

1. GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE2 - GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20: These columns are designed to store global attributes related to invoice distributions. The specific meaning and use of these attributes would depend on the organization's business processes and the configuration of the Oracle ERP system. The data type and length of these columns are not provided, but they appear to be nullable as all sample values are None.

2. LINE_GROUP_NUMBER: This column is likely designed to store a number that identifies a group of lines in an invoice distribution. The specific use of this column would depend on the organization's invoice processing procedures. The data type and length of this column are not provided, and all sample values are None.

Relationships and Business Logic:

Without more information, it is difficult to infer specific relationships or business logic. However, given the naming convention of the columns, it is likely that these global attributes are used to categorize or classify invoice distribution lines in some way. The LINE_GROUP_NUMBER could be used to group related lines together, perhaps for reporting or processing purposes.

It is also possible that these global attributes are used to store additional information that is not captured by the standard invoice distribution fields in the Oracle AP module. This could include custom attributes specific to the organization's business processes.

Please note that the actual use of these fields can vary greatly depending on the organization's specific business needs and the configuration of the Oracle ERP system. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with the AP module's system administrator or the organization's business process owner for a more accurate understanding of this object.

Object: AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL is a table in an Oracle ERP system. This table is part of the Accounts Payable (AP) module and is used to store detailed information about invoice distributions. The data in this table is used for various financial and accounting processes such as expense tracking, receipt verification, and multi-reporting currency (MRC) calculations.

Column Descriptions:

1. RECEIPT_VERIFIED_FLAG: This is a flag that indicates whether the receipt associated with the invoice distribution has been verified. If the value is 'None', it means the receipt has not been verified.

2. RECEIPT_REQUIRED_FLAG: This flag indicates whether a receipt is required for the invoice distribution. If the value is 'None', it means a receipt is not required.

3. RECEIPT_MISSING_FLAG: This flag indicates whether the receipt associated with the invoice distribution is missing. If the value is 'None', it means the receipt is not missing.

4. JUSTIFICATION: This field is used to store any justification or explanation related to the invoice distribution.

5. EXPENSE_GROUP: This field is used to categorize the invoice distribution into a specific expense group.

6. START_EXPENSE_DATE: This is the start date of the expense period associated with the invoice distribution.

7. END_EXPENSE_DATE: This is the end date of the expense period associated with the invoice distribution.

8. RECEIPT_CURRENCY_CODE: This field stores the currency code of the receipt associated with the invoice distribution.

9. RECEIPT_CONVERSION_RATE: This field stores the conversion rate used for the receipt currency.

10. RECEIPT_CURRENCY_AMOUNT: This field stores the amount in the receipt currency.

11. DAILY_AMOUNT: This field stores the daily amount of the invoice distribution.

12. WEB_PARAMETER_ID: This field is used to store the ID of the web parameter associated with the invoice distribution.

13. ADJUSTMENT_REASON: This field is used to store the reason for any adjustments made to the invoice distribution.

14. AWARD_ID: This field is used to store the ID of the award associated with the invoice distribution.

15. MRC_ACCRUAL_POSTED_FLAG: This is a flag that indicates whether the multi-reporting currency (MRC) accrual has been posted. If the value is 'None', it means the MRC accrual has not been posted.

16. MRC_CASH_POSTED_FLAG: This is a flag that indicates whether the MRC cash has been posted. If the value is 'None', it means the MRC cash has not been posted.

17. MRC_DIST_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field is used to store the code combination ID for the MRC distribution.

18. MRC_AMOUNT: This field stores the MRC amount for the invoice distribution.

19. MRC_BASE_AMOUNT: This field stores the base MRC amount for the invoice distribution.

20. MRC_BASE_INV_PRICE_VARIANCE: This field stores the base invoice price variance for the MRC.

Please note that the sample data provided does not contain any actual values, hence no specific business logic or relationships can be inferred at this time.

20. **RCV_TRANSACTION_ID:** This field likely represents the ID of the receipt transaction. It could be used to track individual receipt transactions.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:** The table seems to be primarily used for tracking and managing multi-reporting currency (MRC) data. It appears to be closely related to financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign exchange and credit card transactions. The presence of fields for program IDs and request IDs suggests that this table might be used in conjunction with other tables that store program and request data. The 'DIST_MATCH_TYPE' field suggests that there might be a matching process involved, possibly for reconciling invoices with payments or receipts.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table / View

**Description:** The AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is a table that stores the detailed distribution of each invoice. It contains information about the invoice distribution, merchant details, accounting events, and inventory transfer status. This table is essential for tracking and managing invoice distributions, and it plays a crucial role in financial and accounting operations.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `INVOICE_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: A unique identifier for each invoice distribution. This is the primary key of the table.

2. `PARENT_REVERSAL_ID`: The ID of the parent reversal, if any. This field is used when an invoice distribution is reversed.

3. `TAX_RECOVERABLE_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether the tax on the invoice is recoverable. The values can be 'Y' (Yes), 'N' (No), or 'None'.

4. `PA_CC_AR_INVOICE_ID`: The ID of the Accounts Receivable (AR) invoice in the Project Accounting (PA) Cost Center (CC).

5. `PA_CC_AR_INVOICE_LINE_NUM`: The line number of the AR invoice in the PA CC.

6. `PA_CC_PROCESSED_CODE`: The processed code of the PA CC.

7. `MERCHANT_DOCUMENT_NUMBER`: The document number provided by the merchant.

8. `MERCHANT_NAME`: The name of the merchant.

9. `MERCHANT_REFERENCE`: The reference provided by the merchant.

10. `MERCHANT_TAX_REG_NUMBER`: The tax registration number of the merchant.

11. `MERCHANT_TAXPAYER_ID`: The taxpayer ID of the merchant.

12. `COUNTRY_OF_SUPPLY`: The country where the goods or services are supplied.

13. `MATCHED_UOM_LOOKUP_CODE`: The lookup code for the unit of measure (UOM) that is matched.

14. `GMS_BURDENABLE_RAW_COST`: The raw cost that is burdenable in the Grants Management System (GMS).

15. `ACCOUNTING_EVENT_ID`: The ID of the accounting event associated with the invoice distribution.

16. `PREPAY_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: The ID of the prepayment distribution, if any.

17. `UPGRADE_POSTED_AMT`: The amount posted after an upgrade.

18. `UPGRADE_BASE_POSTED_AMT`: The base amount posted after an upgrade.

19. `INVENTORY_TRANSFER_STATUS`: The status of the inventory transfer. The value can be 'N' (No) or 'Y' (Yes).

20. `COMPANY_PREPAID_INVOICE_ID`: The ID of the prepaid invoice of the company.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The `INVOICE_DISTRIBUTION_ID` is likely used as a foreign key in other tables to establish relationships with the invoice distribution. The `PARENT_REVERSAL_ID` is used to link to the original invoice distribution when a reversal occurs. The `ACCOUNTING_EVENT_ID` might be used to link to a table that stores detailed accounting events. The `PA_CC_AR_INVOICE_ID` and `PA_CC_AR_INVOICE_LINE_NUM` are likely used together to identify a specific line item in an AR invoice in the PA CC. The `PREPAY_DISTRIBUTION_ID` and `COMPANY_PREPAID_INVOICE_ID` are likely used to link to prepayment distributions and prepaid invoices, respectively.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table or View

**Business Purpose:** This object stores detailed information about invoice distributions in the Oracle ERP system. It is used to track and manage various aspects of invoice distributions, including reversal flags, withheld amounts, prepayment flags, price corrections, cancellations, and more. This information is crucial for financial management, auditing, and reporting purposes.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. **CC_REVERSAL_FLAG:** This field indicates whether a cost center reversal has been performed. It is likely a binary flag where a specific value represents 'Yes' and another represents 'No'.

2. **AWT_WITHHELD_AMT:** This field represents the amount withheld for Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT).

3. **INVOICE_INCLUDES_PREPAY_FLAG:** This field indicates whether the invoice includes a prepayment. It is likely a binary flag.

4. **PRICE_CORRECT_INV_ID:** This field likely represents the identifier of an invoice where a price correction has been made.

5. **PRICE_CORRECT_QTY:** This field likely represents the quantity corrected in a price correction.

6. **PA_CMT_XFACE_FLAG:** The purpose of this field is unclear from the provided data and name.

7. **CANCELLATION_FLAG:** This field indicates whether the invoice distribution has been cancelled. It is likely a binary flag.

8. **INVOICE_LINE_NUMBER:** This field represents the line number of the invoice.

9. **CORRECTED_INVOICE_DIST_ID:** This field likely represents the identifier of the corrected invoice distribution.

10. **ROUNDING_AMT:** This field represents the amount of rounding applied to the invoice distribution.

11. **CHARGE_APPLICABLE_TO_DIST_ID:** This field likely represents the identifier of the distribution to which a charge is applicable.

12. **CORRECTED_QUANTITY:** This field likely represents the corrected quantity in the invoice distribution.

13. **RELATED_ID:** This field likely represents the identifier of a related record.

14. **ASSET_BOOK_TYPE_CODE:** This field represents the code of the asset book type.

15. **ASSET_CATEGORY_ID:** This field represents the identifier of the asset category.

16. **DISTRIBUTION_CLASS:** This field represents the class of the distribution. In the sample data, all entries are 'PERMANENT'.

17. **FINAL_PAYMENT_ROUNDING:** This field likely represents the final rounding applied to the payment.

18. **FINAL_APPLICATION_ROUNDING:** This field likely represents the final rounding applied to the application.

19. **AMOUNT_AT_PREPAY_XRATE:** This field likely represents the amount at the prepayment exchange rate.

20. **CASH_BASIS_FINAL_APP_ROUNDING:** This field likely represents the final rounding applied to the cash basis application.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:** The table seems to be related to other tables or views in the AP schema, such as those containing invoice, asset book, and asset category information. The various ID fields suggest relationships with these other tables. The presence of flags and identifiers for corrections and cancellations suggest business logic around managing changes to invoice distributions.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** This object is part of an Oracle ERP system and appears to be used for tracking and managing invoice distributions, specifically related to tax calculations and recoveries. It seems to be used to store information about the tax details of each invoice distribution, including tax codes, rates, amounts, and recovery details.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `AMOUNT_AT_PREPAY_PAY_XRATE`: This field is likely to represent the amount at the prepayment exchange rate. However, the sample data does not provide any values to confirm this.

2. `INTENDED_USE`: This field is intended to capture the use of the invoice distribution. The sample data does not provide any values to confirm this.

3. `DETAIL_TAX_DIST_ID`: This field is likely to be the unique identifier for the detailed tax distribution.

4. `REC_NREC_RATE`: This field appears to represent the recovery and non-recovery rate for the tax.

5. `RECOVERY_RATE_ID`: This field is likely to be the unique identifier for the recovery rate.

6. `RECOVERY_RATE_NAME`: This field appears to represent the name of the recovery rate.

7. `RECOVERY_TYPE_CODE`: This field is likely to represent the type of recovery.

8. `RECOVERY_RATE_CODE`: This field appears to represent the code of the recovery rate.

9. `WITHHOLDING_TAX_CODE_ID`: This field is likely to represent the unique identifier for the withholding tax code.

10. `TAX_ALREADY_DISTRIBUTED_FLAG`: This field appears to be a flag indicating whether the tax has already been distributed.

11. `SUMMARY_TAX_LINE_ID`: This field is likely to be the unique identifier for the summary tax line.

12. `TAXABLE_AMOUNT`: This field appears to represent the taxable amount of the invoice distribution.

13. `TAXABLE_BASE_AMOUNT`: This field appears to represent the base amount that is taxable.

14. `EXTRA_PO_ERV`: The purpose of this field is unclear from the column name and the sample data.

15. `PREPAY_TAX_DIFF_AMOUNT`: This field is likely to represent the difference amount in the prepayment tax.

16. `TAX_CODE_ID`: This field is likely to be the unique identifier for the tax code.

17. `VAT_CODE`: This field appears to represent the VAT (Value Added Tax) code.

18. `AMOUNT_INCLUDES_TAX_FLAG`: This field appears to be a flag indicating whether the amount includes tax.

19. `TAX_CALCULATED_FLAG`: This field appears to be a flag indicating whether the tax has been calculated.

20. `TAX_RECOVERY_RATE`: This field appears to represent the tax recovery rate.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

The `DETAIL_TAX_DIST_ID`, `RECOVERY_RATE_ID`, `SUMMARY_TAX_LINE_ID`, `TAX_CODE_ID`, and `WITHHOLDING_TAX_CODE_ID` fields are likely foreign keys linking to other tables in the database. These relationships would allow for detailed tracking and analysis of tax distributions and recoveries across different invoices.

The presence of fields like `TAX_ALREADY_DISTRIBUTED_FLAG`, `AMOUNT_INCLUDES_TAX_FLAG`, and `TAX_CALCULATED_FLAG` suggests that the table may be used to track the status of tax calculations and distributions for each invoice. 

The `REC_NREC_RATE`, `TAXABLE_AMOUNT`, `TAXABLE_BASE_AMOUNT`, and `TAX_RECOVERY_RATE` fields suggest that the table may be used to calculate tax amounts and recovery rates for each invoice distribution.

14. `RELATED_RETAINAGE_DIST_ID`: This field is the identifier for the related retainage distribution.

15. `RETAINED_AMOUNT_REMAINING`: This field represents the remaining amount of the retained invoice distribution.

16. `BC_EVENT_ID`: This field is the identifier for the business event.

17. `RETAINED_INVOICE_DIST_ID`: This field is the identifier for the retained invoice distribution.

18. `FINAL_RELEASE_ROUNDING`: This field represents the final release rounding for the invoice distribution.

19. `FULLY_PAID_ACCTD_FLAG`: This field indicates whether the invoice distribution has been fully paid and accounted for.

20. `ROOT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: This field is the identifier for the root invoice distribution.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

The `OLD_DISTRIBUTION_ID` and `OLD_DIST_LINE_NUMBER` fields suggest that there is a relationship between current and previous invoice distributions. The `PREPAY_TAX_PARENT_ID` and `AWT_RELATED_ID` fields suggest relationships with other tax-related entities. The `RELATED_RETAINAGE_DIST_ID` and `RETAINED_INVOICE_DIST_ID` fields suggest relationships with other retainage-related entities. The `BC_EVENT_ID` field suggests a relationship with business events. The `ROOT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` field suggests a hierarchical relationship among invoice distributions.

Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL is a table or view in the Oracle ERP system. This object is part of the Accounts Payable (AP) module and is used to store information related to invoice distributions. This specific group of columns seems to be related to specific types of invoice distributions such as reversals, recurring payments, and derived distributions.

Column Details:

1. XINV_PARENT_REVERSAL_ID: This field is likely to store the unique identifier of the parent invoice that has been reversed. In the context of accounts payable, a reversal refers to the cancellation of an invoice that has been previously posted. The sample data does not provide any specific values, suggesting that there may not have been any reversals in the selected data.

2. RECURRING_PAYMENT_ID: This field is expected to hold the unique identifier for recurring payments. Recurring payments are regular payments that are made for ongoing services or goods. The absence of data in the sample suggests that the selected invoices may not be associated with recurring payments.

3. RELEASE_INV_DIST_DERIVED_FROM: This field appears to store the identifier of the original invoice distribution from which the current distribution is derived. This could be used in situations where an invoice distribution is split or adjusted, and it's necessary to track back to the original distribution. The sample data does not contain any specific values, indicating that the selected invoices may not have derived distributions.

4. PAY_AWT_GROUP_ID: This field likely stores the unique identifier for the Automatic Withholding Tax (AWT) group associated with the payment. AWT is a method of tax collection where certain amounts are automatically deducted from payments to suppliers. The absence of data in the sample suggests that the selected invoices may not be associated with any AWT groups.

Relationships and Business Logic:

The relationships between these fields and other tables or views in the system cannot be determined from the provided information. However, it can be inferred that these fields are likely related to other tables or views that store details about invoices, payments, and tax groups.

The business logic behind these fields seems to be tracking and managing different aspects of invoice distributions, such as reversals, recurring payments, derived distributions, and tax withholdings. This can be crucial for accurate financial reporting and audit purposes.
