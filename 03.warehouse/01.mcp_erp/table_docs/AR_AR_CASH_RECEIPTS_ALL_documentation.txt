**Object Name: AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL**

The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL is a table in an Oracle ERP system that contains information about all cash receipts in the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. The table is used to track and manage all cash transactions, including payments from customers, miscellaneous payments, and reversals. It is crucial for financial reporting, auditing, and cash flow management.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `CASH_RECEIPT_ID`: This is the unique identifier for each cash receipt. It is used to uniquely identify each transaction in the table.

2. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who last updated the record.

3. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: This field records the date and time when the record was last updated.

4. `LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN`: This field records the login ID of the user who last updated the record.

5. `CREATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who created the record.

6. `CREATION_DATE`: This field records the date and time when the record was created.

7. `AMOUNT`: This field records the amount of the cash receipt. Negative values may indicate a reversal or refund.

8. `SET_OF_BOOKS_ID`: This field records the ID of the set of books (financial reporting entity) that the cash receipt belongs to.

9. `CURRENCY_CODE`: This field records the currency code of the cash receipt amount.

10. `RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID`: This field records the ID of the receivables transaction associated with the cash receipt.

11. `PAY_FROM_CUSTOMER`: This field records the ID of the customer who made the payment.

12. `STATUS`: This field records the status of the cash receipt. For example, 'APP' might stand for 'Approved', and 'REV' might stand for 'Reversed'.

13. `TYPE`: This field records the type of the cash receipt. For example, 'MISC' might stand for 'Miscellaneous', and 'CASH' might stand for 'Cash'.

14. `RECEIPT_NUMBER`: This field records the receipt number of the cash receipt.

15. `RECEIPT_DATE`: This field records the date of the cash receipt.

16. `MISC_PAYMENT_SOURCE`: This field records the source of miscellaneous payments.

17. `COMMENTS`: This field records any additional comments or notes about the cash receipt.

18. `DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID`: This field records the ID of the distribution set associated with the cash receipt.

19. `REVERSAL_DATE`: This field records the date of reversal for reversed cash receipts.

20. `REVERSAL_CATEGORY`: This field records the category of reversal for reversed cash receipts.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The `CASH_RECEIPT_ID` is likely the primary key of the table. The `LAST_UPDATED_BY`, `CREATED_BY`, `SET_OF_BOOKS_ID`, `RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID`, `PAY_FROM_CUSTOMER`, and `DISTRIBUTION_SET_ID` fields are likely foreign keys linking to other tables in the database, such as user tables, customer tables, receivables transaction tables, and financial books tables. 

The `AMOUNT` field can be positive or negative, indicating payments or reversals respectively. The `STATUS` and `TYPE` fields use codes to categorize the cash receipts. The `RECEIPT_DATE` and `REVERSAL_DATE` fields are used to track the timeline of transactions. The `COMMENTS` field provides additional context for each transaction.

**Object Name:** AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL table/view is used in the Oracle ERP system to store information related to cash receipts. This object is crucial for managing and tracking all cash transactions, including payments from customers. It aids in the financial management and auditing processes by providing a comprehensive record of all cash transactions.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `REFERENCE_ID`: This field is likely to store a unique identifier for each record in the table. The sample data does not provide any values, suggesting that this field might be optional or not frequently used.

2. `CUSTOMER_RECEIPT_REFERENCE`: This field is likely to store a reference to the receipt provided to the customer. This could be a unique identifier or code. The sample data does not provide any values, suggesting that this field might be optional or not frequently used.

3. `OVERRIDE_REMIT_ACCOUNT_FLAG`: This field stores a flag (Y/N) indicating whether the remittance account has been overridden for a particular transaction. This could be used in situations where the default remittance account needs to be changed for a specific transaction.

4. `ORG_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier for the organization associated with the cash receipt. This could be used to filter or group transactions by organization.

5. `ANTICIPATED_CLEARING_DATE`: This field is likely to store the date when the transaction is expected to be cleared. The sample data does not provide any values, suggesting that this field might be optional or not frequently used.

6. `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1` to `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE15`: These fields are likely to be customizable fields that can be used to store additional information about the cash receipt. The specific use of these fields may vary depending on the organization's needs. The sample data does not provide any values, suggesting that these fields might be optional or not frequently used.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:**

The `ORG_ID` field likely relates to an Organizations table in the database, where additional details about the organization can be found. The `REFERENCE_ID` and `CUSTOMER_RECEIPT_REFERENCE` fields might be related to other tables or views in the database that store detailed transaction or customer information.

The `OVERRIDE_REMIT_ACCOUNT_FLAG` field suggests that there is a default remittance account associated with each transaction, which can be overridden if necessary. This implies some business logic around the management of remittance accounts.

The `ANTICIPATED_CLEARING_DATE` field suggests that there might be a process or workflow for clearing transactions, which could involve other tables or views in the database.

The `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE` fields suggest that the table is designed to be flexible and customizable to accommodate a variety of business needs.

# AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL Table Documentation

## Overview
The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL table is a part of the Oracle ERP system, specifically within the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. This table appears to store detailed information about cash receipts, including various attributes, issuer details, exchange rates, payment server details, and tax information. The data in this table is crucial for financial reporting, auditing, and cash flow management.

## Column Descriptions

1. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE16 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20**: These columns are likely used to store additional information about the cash receipt that doesn't fit into the other fields. The specific nature of the data stored in these fields may vary depending on the business's needs.

2. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY**: This field is likely used to categorize the global attributes. The specific categories used would depend on the business's needs.

3. **ISSUER_NAME**: This field stores the name of the entity that issued the cash receipt.

4. **ISSUE_DATE**: This field stores the date when the cash receipt was issued.

5. **ISSUER_BANK_BRANCH_ID**: This field stores the unique identifier of the bank branch of the issuer.

6. **CUSTOMER_BANK_BRANCH_ID**: This field stores the unique identifier of the bank branch of the customer.

7. **MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE**: This field stores the type of exchange rate used for multi-currency transactions.

8. **MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE**: This field stores the exchange rate used for multi-currency transactions.

9. **MRC_EXCHANGE_DATE**: This field stores the date when the exchange rate was applied.

10. **PAYMENT_SERVER_ORDER_NUM**: This field stores the order number from the payment server.

11. **APPROVAL_CODE**: This field stores the approval code for the cash receipt.

12. **ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_CODE**: This field stores the code resulting from an address verification process.

13. **TAX_RATE**: This field stores the tax rate applied to the transaction.

14. **ACTUAL_VALUE_DATE**: This field stores the date when the cash receipt was actually valued.

15. **POSTMARK_DATE**: This field stores the postmark date of the cash receipt.

16. **APPLICATION_NOTES**: This field stores any notes or comments related to the cash receipt.

## Inferred Relationships and Business Logic
Given the nature of the data, it's likely that this table is related to other tables in the Accounts Receivable module, such as those containing detailed customer information, bank branch details, and tax rates. The actual relationships would depend on the specific schema of the database.

The business logic inferred from this table includes the calculation of the value of multi-currency transactions using the exchange rate and the application of the tax rate to transactions. The approval code and address verification code fields suggest that there are approval and verification processes in place for cash receipts.

**Object Name:** AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL

**Object Description:** The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL table in the Oracle ERP system stores information related to cash receipts in the Accounts Receivable module. This table is crucial for tracking and managing all cash receipts, which are payments received from customers. It includes details about the receipt, any errors that occurred during processing, and the status of the work item associated with the receipt.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `UNIQUE_REFERENCE`: A unique identifier for each cash receipt. This is likely a system-generated value.

2. `PROMISE_SOURCE`: The source of the promise to pay. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

3. `REC_VERSION_NUMBER`: The version number of the record. This could be used for tracking changes to the record over time.

4. `CC_ERROR_CODE`: The error code associated with credit card processing. If no error occurred, this field is null.

5. `CC_ERROR_TEXT`: The error text or message associated with credit card processing. If no error occurred, this field is null.

6. `CC_ERROR_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether an error occurred during credit card processing. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

7. `REMIT_BANK_ACCT_USE_ID`: The ID of the bank account used for remittance.

8. `OLD_CUSTOMER_BANK_BRANCH_ID`: The ID of the customer's old bank branch. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

9. `OLD_ISSUER_BANK_BRANCH_ID`: The ID of the old bank branch that issued the payment. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

10. `LEGAL_ENTITY_ID`: The ID of the legal entity associated with the cash receipt.

11. `PAYMENT_TRXN_EXTENSION_ID`: The ID of the payment transaction extension. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

12. `AX_ACCOUNTED_FLAG`: A flag indicating whether the cash receipt has been accounted for. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

13. `OLD_CUSTOMER_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID`: The ID of the customer's old bank account. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

14. `CASH_APPLN_OWNER_ID`: The ID of the owner of the cash application. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

15. `WORK_ITEM_ASSIGNMENT_DATE`: The date the work item was assigned. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

16. `WORK_ITEM_REVIEW_DATE`: The date the work item was reviewed. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

17. `WORK_ITEM_STATUS_CODE`: The status code of the work item. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

18. `WORK_ITEM_REVIEW_NOTE`: Any notes associated with the review of the work item. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

19. `PREV_PAY_FROM_CUSTOMER`: The previous payment from the customer. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

20. `PREV_CUSTOMER_SITE_USE_ID`: The ID of the previous site used by the customer. The sample data does not provide any values for this field.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The table appears to be a transactional table that records individual cash receipts. Each row represents a unique cash receipt, as indicated by the `UNIQUE_REFERENCE` field. There may be relationships with other tables in the database, such as a Customers table (linked via `LEGAL_ENTITY_ID`), a Bank Accounts table (linked via `REMIT_BANK_ACCT_USE_ID`), and a Work Items table (linked via `WORK_ITEM_STATUS_CODE`). The presence of 'old' fields like `OLD_CUSTOMER_BANK_BRANCH_ID` and `OLD_CUSTOMER_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID` suggests that the system tracks changes to customer bank details over time.

Object Name: AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL

The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL is a table in the Oracle ERP system. This table is part of the Accounts Receivable (AR) module and is used to store all the information related to cash receipts. The purpose of this table is to track and manage all cash receipts, which are payments received by the company from its customers.

This is the seventh group of columns in the AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL table. The columns in this group are:

1. WORK_ITEM_EXCEPTION_REASON: This column is designed to store any exceptions or issues that occurred during the processing of a work item. An exception could be any event that interrupts the normal flow of processing, such as an error or a failure. The data type of this column is text. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which indicates that there were no exceptions during the processing of these work items.

2. AUTOMATCH_SET_ID: This column is intended to store the identification number of the set of rules used for automatic matching. Automatic matching is a feature that matches transactions based on certain criteria, such as the amount, date, or reference number. The data type of this column is numeric. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which suggests that automatic matching was not used for these transactions.

3. AUTOAPPLY_FLAG: This column is used to indicate whether the auto-apply feature was used for a transaction. The auto-apply feature automatically applies a receipt to an open transaction when the receipt is saved. The data type of this column is character, with 'Y' indicating that auto-apply was used and 'N' indicating that it was not. In the provided sample data, most values are None, with one row having a value of 'N', indicating that auto-apply was not used for that transaction.

4. SEQ_TYPE_LAST: This column is designed to store the last sequence type used for a transaction. The sequence type is a parameter that determines the order in which transactions are processed. The data type of this column is text. In the provided sample data, all values are None, which suggests that the sequence type was not specified for these transactions.

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that this table is used to track the processing of cash receipts, including any exceptions that occur, the use of automatic matching and auto-apply, and the sequence type used. However, the sample data does not provide any specific examples of these features being used.
