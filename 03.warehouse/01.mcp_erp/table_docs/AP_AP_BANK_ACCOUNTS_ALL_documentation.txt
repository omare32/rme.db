Object Name: AP.AP_BANK_ACCOUNTS_ALL

The AP.AP_BANK_ACCOUNTS_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is a table that contains information related to bank accounts used in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table is crucial for managing and tracking all bank account details associated with the financial transactions in the system. It is the sixth group of fields in this table.

Column Details:

1. BR_FACTOR_CCID: This column likely represents the Cost Center ID (CCID) associated with a bank reconciliation factor. The CCID is a unique identifier used to track costs within an organization. The specific use of this field would depend on the business's accounting practices.

2. BR_STD_RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID: This column likely represents the Transaction ID for standard receivables associated with bank reconciliation. This ID would be used to track individual transactions within the system.

3. ALLOW_MULTI_ASSIGNMENTS_FLAG: This column is a flag (Yes/No or True/False indicator) that indicates whether multiple assignments are allowed for a particular bank account. If set to 'Yes' or 'True', more than one assignment can be linked to the bank account.

4. AGENCY_LOCATION_CODE: This column likely represents a unique code assigned to the location of the agency or branch of the bank. This would be used to identify where the bank account is held.

5. IBAN_NUMBER: This column represents the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the bank account. The IBAN is an internationally agreed system of identifying bank accounts across national borders to facilitate the communication and processing of cross border transactions.

Relationships and Business Logic:

The AP.AP_BANK_ACCOUNTS_ALL table would likely have relationships with other tables in the Oracle ERP system. For example, it might link to a transactions table via the BR_STD_RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID field, or to a cost center table via the BR_FACTOR_CCID field.

The ALLOW_MULTI_ASSIGNMENTS_FLAG field might be used in business logic to control how transactions are assigned to bank accounts. For example, if multiple assignments are not allowed, a check could be implemented to prevent more than one transaction from being assigned to the same bank account.
