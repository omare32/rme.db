## AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL Table Documentation

The `AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL` table in the Oracle ERP system is designed to store information related to holds placed on invoices in the Accounts Payable module. This table is crucial for managing and tracking the status of invoice holds, the reasons for these holds, and any actions taken to release these holds.

### Column Descriptions

1. `INVOICE_ID`: This is the unique identifier for each invoice. It is a primary key in the table.

2. `LINE_LOCATION_ID`: This field represents the unique identifier for a specific line item location on the invoice. It may be null if the hold applies to the entire invoice and not a specific line item.

3. `HOLD_LOOKUP_CODE`: This field represents the code for the type of hold placed on the invoice. Examples include 'PRICE', 'DIST VARIANCE', 'LINE VARIANCE', 'INSUFFICIENT FUNDS', and 'QUALITY'.

4. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: This timestamp field records the last date and time the hold record was updated.

5. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who last updated the hold record.

6. `HELD_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who placed the hold on the invoice.

7. `HOLD_DATE`: This timestamp field records the date and time when the hold was placed on the invoice.

8. `HOLD_REASON`: This field provides a detailed description of the reason for the hold.

9. `RELEASE_LOOKUP_CODE`: This field represents the code for the type of release applied to the hold. Examples include 'INVOICE QUICK RELEASE', 'VARIANCE CORRECTED', 'FUNDS NOW AVAILABLE', and 'MATCHED'.

10. `RELEASE_REASON`: This field provides a detailed description of the reason for the hold release.

11. `STATUS_FLAG`: This field indicates the current status of the hold. 'S' indicates that the hold is still in place, while 'R' indicates that the hold has been released.

12. `LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN`: This field records the login ID of the user who last updated the hold record. This field may be null if the record has not been updated since its creation.

13. `CREATION_DATE`: This timestamp field records the date and time when the hold record was created.

14. `CREATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who created the hold record.

15. `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: This field is reserved for future use.

16. `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE5`: These fields are reserved for future use and can be used to store additional information related to the hold.

### Relationships and Business Logic

The `INVOICE_ID` field likely links to an `INVOICES` table in the Accounts Payable module, providing a direct relationship between the hold and the specific invoice it applies to.

The `LINE_LOCATION_ID` field likely links to a `LINE_LOCATIONS` or similar table, providing a link between the hold and a specific line item on the invoice.

The `HOLD_LOOKUP_CODE` and `RELEASE_LOOKUP_CODE` fields likely link to a lookup table containing detailed descriptions of each code.

The `LAST_UPDATED_BY`, `HELD_BY`, and `CREATED_BY` fields likely link to a `USERS` or similar table, providing information about the users who interact with the hold records.

The `STATUS_FLAG` field is used to quickly identify whether a hold is still in place or has been released. This can be used in reporting and auditing processes.

## AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL Table Documentation

The `AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL` table in the Oracle ERP system is a part of the Accounts Payable module. It is used to store information related to holds placed on transactions. Holds are typically placed on transactions when there are discrepancies or issues that need to be resolved before the transaction can be processed.

### Column Descriptions

- `ATTRIBUTE6` to `ATTRIBUTE15`: These are generic attribute fields that can be used to store additional information related to the hold. The specific use of these fields can vary depending on the business needs. In the provided sample data, these fields are not in use.

- `ORG_ID`: This field represents the identifier for the organization. Each organization in the system is assigned a unique ID, and this field links the hold to the specific organization.

- `RESPONSIBILITY_ID`: This field represents the identifier for the responsibility. Each responsibility in the system is assigned a unique ID. The responsibility typically refers to a role or a set of permissions that determine what actions a user can perform in the system.

- `RCV_TRANSACTION_ID`: This field represents the identifier for the receiving transaction. Each transaction in the system is assigned a unique ID. This field links the hold to the specific transaction.

- `HOLD_DETAILS`: This field is used to store any additional details or notes about the hold. This could include information about why the hold was placed or what needs to be done to resolve it.

- `LINE_NUMBER`: This field represents the line number of the transaction that the hold is associated with. If a transaction has multiple lines, each line can have a separate hold.

- `HOLD_ID`: This field represents the identifier for the hold. Each hold in the system is assigned a unique ID.

- `WF_STATUS`: This field represents the status of the workflow associated with the hold. The workflow typically includes the steps that need to be taken to resolve the hold.

- `VALIDATION_REQUEST_ID`: This field represents the identifier for the validation request associated with the hold. Validation requests are typically used to check that the transaction meets certain criteria before it can be processed.

### Relationships and Business Logic

The `ORG_ID`, `RESPONSIBILITY_ID`, and `RCV_TRANSACTION_ID` fields are foreign keys that link the `AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL` table to other tables in the system. The `ORG_ID` links to the organization table, the `RESPONSIBILITY_ID` links to the responsibility table, and the `RCV_TRANSACTION_ID` links to the transaction table.

The `HOLD_ID` field is a primary key that uniquely identifies each record in the `AP.AP_HOLDS_ALL` table.

The `WF_STATUS` field can be used to track the progress of resolving the hold. The specific values for this field will depend on the workflow defined by the business.
