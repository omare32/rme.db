- `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: This field might be used to categorize attributes of the receipt method. However, based on the sample data, it appears to be unused.

- `ATTRIBUTE1`, `ATTRIBUTE2`, `ATTRIBUTE3`, `ATTRIBUTE4`: These fields might be used to store additional attributes or properties of the receipt method. However, based on the sample data, they appear to be unused.

## Relationships and Business Logic

The `RECEIPT_METHOD_ID` is the primary key in this table and can be used to link to other tables where receipt methods are referenced. The `RECEIPT_CLASS_ID` can be used to join with a Receipt Class table, if one exists, to provide more details about the class of the receipt method.

The `CREATED_BY` and `LAST_UPDATED_BY` fields likely reference a User or Employee table to provide details about the individuals who created or last updated the receipt method.

The `AUTO_PRINT_PROGRAM_ID` and `AUTO_TRANS_PROGRAM_ID` fields suggest that there may be associated tables for automatic print and transaction programs, although these fields are not used in the sample data.

The `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY` and `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE4` fields suggest that the table is designed to accommodate additional attributes or properties of receipt methods, although these fields are not used in the sample data.

**Object Name:** AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Description:** The AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS object is a table in the Oracle ERP system that stores information related to different methods of receipt in the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. The table is used to manage and track the various methods by which payments are received from customers. The table appears to be part of a larger structure, as this is the second group of four.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. **ATTRIBUTE5 to ATTRIBUTE15:** These columns are likely used to store additional attributes or characteristics related to the receipt methods. The exact nature of these attributes is not clear from the sample data provided, as all the values are 'None'. These could be optional fields or placeholders for future use.

2. **PRINTED_NAME:** This column stores the name of the receipt method as it would appear on printed documents or reports. The names suggest different types of payment methods like 'Cash', 'Check', 'Bank Transfer', etc.

3. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE1 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE8:** These columns are likely used to store global attributes related to the receipt methods. The exact nature of these attributes is not clear from the sample data provided, as all the values are 'None'. These could be optional fields or placeholders for future use.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:** 

Based on the sample data, it appears that each row in the table represents a unique receipt method. The 'PRINTED_NAME' field could potentially be used as a unique identifier for each method. However, without more information or context, it's difficult to infer specific relationships or business logic. 

The presence of 'None' values in all the ATTRIBUTE and GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields suggests that these fields might not be currently in use, or they are used optionally depending on the specific business requirements or rules. 

The table likely interacts with other tables in the AR module, such as those storing transaction or customer information, to track and manage payments received.

**Object Name:** AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS object in the Oracle ERP system is designed to store information related to the various methods of receipt in the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. This table is essential for managing and tracking different types of payments and their associated attributes in the system.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE9 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20:** These columns are designed to store additional attributes related to the receipt methods. The specific purpose of these attributes can vary based on the business needs and can be customized accordingly. In the provided sample data, these fields are not populated.

2. **GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY:** This column is intended to categorize the global attributes. The specific categories can be defined based on the business requirements. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

3. **PAYMENT_TYPE_CODE:** This column stores the code associated with the type of payment. For example, it could be 'CASH', 'CHECK', 'CREDIT CARD', etc. In the provided sample data, the payment type code is 'NONE'.

4. **MERCHANT_ID:** This column is designed to store the unique identifier for the merchant. This could be used to link the receipt method to a specific merchant in the system. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

5. **RECEIPT_INHERIT_INV_NUM_FLAG:** This column is a flag that indicates whether the receipt inherits the invoice number. This could be used for tracking and linking purposes. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

6. **DM_INHERIT_RECEIPT_NUM_FLAG:** This column is a flag that indicates whether the Direct Message (DM) inherits the receipt number. This could be used for communication and tracking purposes. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

7. **BR_CUST_TRX_TYPE_ID:** This column stores the identifier for the customer transaction type in the Brazil localization. This could be used to categorize and track transactions based on specific types. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

8. **BR_MIN_ACCTD_AMOUNT:** This column is designed to store the minimum accounted amount for the Brazil localization. This could be used for validation and control purposes. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

9. **BR_MAX_ACCTD_AMOUNT:** This column is designed to store the maximum accounted amount for the Brazil localization. This could be used for validation and control purposes. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

**Inferred Relationships or Business Logic:** 

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that this table could potentially be linked to other tables in the system using fields like MERCHANT_ID and BR_CUST_TRX_TYPE_ID. The flag fields (RECEIPT_INHERIT_INV_NUM_FLAG and DM_INHERIT_RECEIPT_NUM_FLAG) suggest that there might be a relationship between receipts, invoices, and direct messages. The payment type code could be used to link to a master table of payment types. The Brazil-specific fields suggest that there might be localization-specific business logic or reporting requirements.

Object Name: AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS

The AR.AR_RECEIPT_METHODS table is part of the Accounts Receivable (AR) module in an Oracle ERP system. This table is used to store information related to the methods of receiving payments from customers. It is crucial for managing and tracking the different ways customers can make payments, and it helps to streamline the payment process.

Column Descriptions:

1. BR_INHERIT_INV_NUM_FLAG: This is a flag field that indicates whether the invoice number is inherited or not. If the value is 'N', it means the invoice number is not inherited. The purpose of this field is to control the inheritance of invoice numbers, which can be important for tracking and auditing purposes.

2. MERCHANT_REF: This field is used to store the reference number or identifier of the merchant. In the provided sample data, this field is empty, which might indicate that this information is not available or not applicable.

3. PAYMENT_CHANNEL_CODE: This field is used to store the code of the payment channel. Payment channels could include methods like bank transfer, credit card, cash, etc. In the provided sample data, this field is also empty, which might indicate that this information is not available or not applicable.

4. ZD_EDITION_NAME: This field is used to store the name of the edition. In the provided sample data, the value is 'ORA$BASE', which is a default value in Oracle databases. This could be used to identify the specific version or edition of the database or software.

5. ZD_SYNC: This field is used to indicate the synchronization status. In the provided sample data, the value is 'SYNCED', which indicates that the data in this row is synchronized.

Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:

Based on the table name and column names, it can be inferred that this table is likely related to other tables in the AR module, such as AR_INVOICES or AR_PAYMENTS. The relationships between these tables would be based on fields like the invoice number or the payment method.

The business logic can be inferred from the BR_INHERIT_INV_NUM_FLAG field. If this flag is set to 'N', it means that the invoice number is not inherited, which might mean that each payment method has a unique invoice number. This could be important for tracking individual payments and ensuring accurate accounting.
