Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:

The VENDOR_ID field is likely the primary key and may be used to link this table to other tables in the database. The LAST_UPDATED_BY, CREATED_BY, and LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN fields suggest that this table is linked to a user or employee table in the database. The EMPLOYEE_ID, if used, would also link to an employee table. The VENDOR_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE could link to a lookup table containing vendor type definitions. The PARENT_VENDOR_ID suggests a self-referential relationship, where a vendor can be related to another vendor.
