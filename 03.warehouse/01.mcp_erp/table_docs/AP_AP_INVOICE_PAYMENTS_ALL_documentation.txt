- `PAYMENT_BASE_AMOUNT`: This field records the base amount of the payment. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated for most rows.

- `ATTRIBUTE1` to `ATTRIBUTE15`: These fields are generic attribute fields that can be used to store additional information related to the payment. The exact usage of these fields can vary based on the business requirements and can be customized accordingly. In the provided sample data, these fields are not populated.

### Relationships and Business Logic

The relationships and business logic cannot be fully determined from the provided sample data. However, it can be inferred that the `EXCHANGE_RATE` and `EXCHANGE_DATE` fields are likely related, as the exchange rate would be determined on a specific date. Similarly, the `DISCOUNT_LOST` and `DISCOUNT_TAKEN` fields may be related to the `INVOICE_BASE_AMOUNT` and `PAYMENT_BASE_AMOUNT` fields, as discounts would affect these amounts.

The `GAIN_CODE_COMBINATION_ID` and `LOSS_CODE_COMBINATION_ID` fields suggest that there may be other tables in the database that store details about gains and losses from payment transactions, which would be linked via these ID fields. The `ATTRIBUTE` fields suggest that this table can be customized to store additional information as required by the business.

Object Name: AP.AP_INVOICE_PAYMENTS_ALL

The AP.AP_INVOICE_PAYMENTS_ALL object is a table in the Oracle ERP system. It is part of the Accounts Payable (AP) module and is used to store all the invoice payment information. This particular group of fields primarily contains global attributes, which are typically used to store additional information that is not covered by the standard fields in the table. The specific business purpose of these fields can vary depending on the organization's needs and the specific configuration of the ERP system.

Column Descriptions:

1. GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE4 to GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20: These are general-purpose fields that can be used to store additional information about the invoice payment. The specific use of these fields can vary greatly depending on the organization's needs. In the provided sample data, these fields are all null, suggesting that they may not be in use.

2. EXTERNAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID: This field is likely used to store a unique identifier for the bank account that is used for the payment. This could be used to link the payment record to a separate table or view that contains detailed information about the bank account.

3. MRC_EXCHANGE_DATE: This field is likely used to store the date of the exchange rate that was used for the payment. This would be relevant for payments that involve a currency conversion.

4. MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE: This field is likely used to store the exchange rate that was used for the payment. This would be relevant for payments that involve a currency conversion.

Relationships and Business Logic:

The EXTERNAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_ID field suggests that this table or view may be linked to another object that contains detailed information about the bank accounts used for payments. The MRC_EXCHANGE_DATE and MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE fields suggest that the system may be configured to handle payments in multiple currencies, with the ability to store the specific exchange rate used for each payment. 

The use of the GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields suggests that this table or view is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the organization's needs. These fields can be used to store a wide variety of additional information about the payments, depending on what is relevant for the organization. However, in the provided sample data, these fields are all null, suggesting that they may not currently be in use.

**Object Name:** AP.AP_INVOICE_PAYMENTS_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** This object stores information related to invoice payments in the Accounts Payable (AP) module of the Oracle ERP system. It is used to track and manage payments made to suppliers, including details about the payment, the supplier, and any associated currency exchange rates.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `MRC_EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE`: This field is used to store the type of exchange rate used for multi-currency transactions. The type of exchange rate can influence the amount paid in a different currency.

2. `MRC_GAIN_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: This field stores the code combination ID for any gains realized from currency exchange rate fluctuations.

3. `MRC_INVOICE_BASE_AMOUNT`: This field represents the base amount of the invoice in the organization's base currency.

4. `MRC_LOSS_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: This field stores the code combination ID for any losses incurred due to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

5. `MRC_PAYMENT_BASE_AMOUNT`: This field represents the base amount of the payment made in the organization's base currency.

6. `REVERSAL_FLAG`: This field indicates whether the payment has been reversed. A 'Y' means the payment has been reversed, while a 'N' means it has not.

7. `REVERSAL_INV_PMT_ID`: This field stores the ID of the reversed invoice payment, if applicable.

8. `IBAN_NUMBER`: This field stores the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) used for the payment.

9. `INVOICING_PARTY_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier of the party issuing the invoice.

10. `INVOICING_PARTY_SITE_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier of the site of the party issuing the invoice.

11. `INVOICING_VENDOR_SITE_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier of the vendor site where the invoice was issued.

12. `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_NAME`: This field stores the name of the supplier to whom the payment is made.

13. `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier of the supplier to whom the payment is made.

14. `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_SITE`: This field stores the site of the supplier to whom the payment is made.

15. `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_SITE_ID`: This field stores the unique identifier of the site of the supplier to whom the payment is made.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

- The `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_ID` and `REMIT_TO_SUPPLIER_SITE_ID` fields are likely related to a Suppliers or Supplier Sites table in the database, providing a link to more detailed supplier information.
- The `INVOICING_PARTY_ID` and `INVOICING_PARTY_SITE_ID` fields are likely related to a Parties or Party Sites table, providing a link to more detailed information about the party issuing the invoice.
- The `MRC_GAIN_CODE_COMBINATION_ID` and `MRC_LOSS_CODE_COMBINATION_ID` fields are likely related to a table that stores details about currency exchange rate gains and losses.
- The `REVERSAL_FLAG` and `REVERSAL_INV_PMT_ID` fields are used together to track reversed payments. If a payment is reversed (`REVERSAL_FLAG` = 'Y'), there should be a corresponding `REVERSAL_INV_PMT_ID`.
- The `MRC_INVOICE_BASE_AMOUNT` and `MRC_PAYMENT_BASE_AMOUNT` fields are used to track the amounts in the base currency, which is important for multi-currency transactions and reporting.
