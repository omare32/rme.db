**Object Name:** AP.AP_CHECK_FORMATS

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Description:** The AP.AP_CHECK_FORMATS object is a table in the Oracle ERP system that stores information related to the formatting and processing of checks in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. This table is crucial for managing the payment process, including the formatting of checks, the programs used to build and format payments, and the grouping of payments by due date.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. **ATTRIBUTE7 to ATTRIBUTE15:** These are generic attribute fields that can be used to store additional information as required by the business. The specific use of these fields may vary depending on the organization's needs.

2. **ZERO_AMOUNTS_ONLY:** This field indicates whether the check format is used only for checks with a zero amount. 'N' means it is not used only for zero amounts, while 'Y' indicates it is.

3. **BUILD_PAYMENTS_PROGRAM_ID:** This field stores the ID of the program used to build the payments. This is a key reference to the program that compiles the payment data.

4. **FORMAT_PAYMENTS_PROGRAM_ID:** This field stores the ID of the program used to format the payments. This is a key reference to the program that formats the payment data for check printing.

5. **PRINT_CHECK_STUB:** This field indicates whether a check stub is printed along with the check. 'Y' means a stub is printed, while 'N' means it is not.

6. **GROUP_BY_DUE_DATE:** This field indicates whether payments are grouped by their due date. 'Y' means payments are grouped by due date, while 'N' means they are not.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

- The BUILD_PAYMENTS_PROGRAM_ID and FORMAT_PAYMENTS_PROGRAM_ID fields suggest that this table is likely linked to another table or view that stores details about the various payment programs.
- The ZERO_AMOUNTS_ONLY, PRINT_CHECK_STUB, and GROUP_BY_DUE_DATE fields are likely used to control the payment and check printing process.
- The ATTRIBUTE and GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE fields suggest that this table can be customized to store additional data as required by the business.

Object Name: AP.AP_CHECK_FORMATS

The AP.AP_CHECK_FORMATS is a table in the Oracle ERP system.
