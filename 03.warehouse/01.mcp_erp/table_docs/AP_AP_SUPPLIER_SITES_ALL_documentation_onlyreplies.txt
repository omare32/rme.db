**Relationships and Business Logic:** 

The `VENDOR_ID` field likely links to a Suppliers table where detailed information about each supplier is stored. The `CREATED_BY` and `LAST_UPDATED_BY` fields likely link to a Users or Employees table to identify who made the changes. 

The flags (`PURCHASING_SITE_FLAG`, `RFQ_ONLY_SITE_FLAG`, `PAY_SITE_FLAG`, `ATTENTION_AR_FLAG`) indicate the functions and characteristics of each site. For example, if `PURCHASING_SITE_FLAG` is 'Y', it means that the site is used for purchasing activities. 

The `VENDOR_SITE_CODE` and `VENDOR_SITE_CODE_ALT` fields might be used in business logic to identify sites in system processes or for reporting purposes. 

The address fields (`ADDRESS_LINE1`, `ADDRESS_LINE2`, `ADDRESS_LINE3`, `CITY`, `STATE`, `ZIP`) are used to store the physical location of the supplier site, which could be used for shipping or billing purposes.
