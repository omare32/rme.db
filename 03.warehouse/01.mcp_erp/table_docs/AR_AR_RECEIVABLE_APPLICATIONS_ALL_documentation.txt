Object Name: AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL

The AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL table in the Oracle ERP system contains information about the applications of receivables in the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. The business purpose of this table is to track and manage the application of payments against outstanding receivables. This includes details about the application type, status, amount applied, and related transaction and receipt information.

Column Descriptions:

1. RECEIVABLE_APPLICATION_ID: This is the unique identifier for each receivable application. It is a primary key in the table.

2. LAST_UPDATED_BY: This field records the ID of the user who last updated the record.

3. LAST_UPDATE_DATE: This timestamp field records the date and time when the record was last updated.

4. CREATED_BY: This field records the ID of the user who created the record.

5. CREATION_DATE: This timestamp field records the date and time when the record was created.

6. AMOUNT_APPLIED: This field records the amount that has been applied or paid towards the receivable.

7. AMOUNT_APPLIED_FROM: This field seems to be unused in the sample data provided. It might be intended to record the source of the applied amount.

8. TRANS_TO_RECEIPT_RATE: This field also seems to be unused in the sample data. It might be intended to record the exchange rate applied if the transaction and receipt are in different currencies.

9. GL_DATE: This field records the date when the transaction was recorded in the General Ledger.

10. CODE_COMBINATION_ID: This field records the ID of the code combination associated with the receivable application.

11. SET_OF_BOOKS_ID: This field records the ID of the set of books where the receivable application is recorded.

12. DISPLAY: This field indicates whether the receivable application is displayed (Y) or not (N).

13. APPLY_DATE: This field records the date when the amount was applied to the receivable.

14. APPLICATION_TYPE: This field records the type of application, such as CASH.

15. STATUS: This field records the status of the application, such as APP (applied) or UNAPP (unapplied).

16. PAYMENT_SCHEDULE_ID: This field records the ID of the payment schedule associated with the receivable application.

17. LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN: This field records the login ID of the user who last updated the record.

18. CASH_RECEIPT_ID: This field records the ID of the cash receipt associated with the receivable application.

19. APPLIED_CUSTOMER_TRX_ID: This field records the ID of the customer transaction where the amount was applied.

20. APPLIED_CUSTOMER_TRX_LINE_ID: This field seems to be unused in the sample data provided. It might be intended to record the ID of the specific line item in the customer transaction where the amount was applied.

Based on the column names and sample data, it can be inferred that this table is primarily used to track the application of payments against receivables. The status and application type fields suggest that the table may be used to manage different types of applications and their statuses. The presence of fields for user and date information suggests that the table also tracks who created and updated each record and when these actions occurred.

Object: AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL

The AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL is a table in the Oracle ERP system that contains information related to the application of payments against receivables. This table is used to track and manage customer transactions, including the application of payments, discounts, and charges. It is an essential part of the accounts receivable process, helping to ensure accurate financial reporting and customer account management.

Columns:

1. APPLIED_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE_ID: This is a unique identifier for the payment schedule that has been applied. It is a numerical value and can be used to track specific payment schedules.

2. CUSTOMER_TRX_ID: This is a unique identifier for the customer transaction. It appears to be null in the sample data, but typically it would be used to link to the specific transaction in the customer transactions table.

3. LINE_APPLIED: This column represents the amount applied to the line item in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

4. TAX_APPLIED: This column represents the amount of tax applied in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

5. FREIGHT_APPLIED: This column represents the amount of freight charges applied in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

6. RECEIVABLES_CHARGES_APPLIED: This column represents the amount of receivables charges applied in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

7. EARNED_DISCOUNT_TAKEN: This column represents the amount of earned discount that has been taken in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

8. UNEARNED_DISCOUNT_TAKEN: This column represents the amount of unearned discount that has been taken in the transaction. It is a numerical value.

9. DAYS_LATE: This column represents the number of days late the payment was received. It is a numerical value.

10. APPLICATION_RULE: This column represents the rule applied for the application of the payment. It is a numerical value.

11. GL_POSTED_DATE: This column represents the date when the transaction was posted to the General Ledger. It is a date value.

12. COMMENTS: This column is for any additional comments related to the transaction. It is a text field.

13. ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY: This column is a category for additional attributes related to the transaction. It is a text field.

14. ATTRIBUTE1 to ATTRIBUTE7: These are additional attribute fields that can be used to store extra information related to the transaction. They are text fields.

Based on the sample data, it appears that some fields may not always be populated, such as the CUSTOMER_TRX_ID and the ATTRIBUTE fields. The APPLICATION_RULE field appears to be a coded value, with specific numbers representing different rules.

# AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL Table Documentation

## Overview
The AR.AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS_ALL table is part of an Oracle ERP system, specifically within the Accounts Receivable (AR) module. This table appears to store detailed information about receivable transactions, including various attributes, identifiers, and discount details. 

## Column Descriptions

- `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE14` to `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE20`: These columns are likely used to store additional, customizable data related to the receivable transaction. The specific purpose of these fields may vary depending on the business's needs. In the provided sample data, these fields are not populated.

- `GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: This column is likely used to categorize the global attributes. The specific categories would depend on the business's needs. In the provided sample data, this field is not populated.

- `CONS_INV_ID` and `CONS_INV_ID_TO`: These columns likely store identifiers for consolidated invoices. The specific use of these fields may depend on the business's invoicing practices. In the provided sample data, these fields are not populated.

- `RULE_SET_ID`: This column likely stores an identifier for a set of rules or policies related to the receivable transaction. The specific rules would depend on the business's policies.

- `LINE_EDISCOUNTED`, `TAX_EDISCOUNTED`, `FREIGHT_EDISCOUNTED`, `CHARGES_EDISCOUNTED`: These columns likely store the amounts for line items, taxes, freight, and other charges after any eligible discounts have been applied.

- `LINE_UEDISCOUNTED`, `TAX_UEDISCOUNTED`, `FREIGHT_UEDISCOUNTED`, `CHARGES_UEDISCOUNTED`: These columns likely store the undiscounted amounts for line items, taxes, freight, and other charges.

- `RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID`: This column likely stores a unique identifier for the receivable transaction.

## Relationships and Business Logic
The `RECEIVABLES_TRX_ID` field is likely a foreign key linking to another table that contains additional details about the receivable transaction. The `RULE_SET_ID` field may also be a foreign key linking to a table that defines the rules or policies for the transaction.

The `*_EDISCOUNTED` and `*_UEDISCOUNTED` fields suggest that the business applies discounts to various components of a transaction, including line items, taxes, freight, and other charges. The specific discount rules and calculations would likely be defined elsewhere in the system.

Please note that the actual usage of these fields may vary depending on the business's specific implementation of the Oracle ERP system.
