Relationships and Business Logic:

The AP.AP_INVOICES_ALL table likely has relationships with other tables in the ERP system. For example, the VENDOR_ID and VENDOR_SITE_ID fields could link to a vendors table that contains detailed information about each vendor. The SET_OF_BOOKS_ID could link to a financial books table.
