Object: AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPT_HISTORY_ALL

The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPT_HISTORY_ALL is a table in an Oracle ERP system that contains historical data about cash receipts. The business purpose of this table is to keep track of all cash receipt transactions, their statuses, amounts, and related information. This data is crucial for financial reporting, auditing, and cash flow management.

Column Descriptions:

1. CASH_RECEIPT_HISTORY_ID: A unique identifier for each record in the cash receipt history table.

2. CASH_RECEIPT_ID: A unique identifier for each cash receipt. This can be used to link to the details of the cash receipt in another table.

3. STATUS: The current status of the cash receipt. Examples include 'CLEARED', 'REMITTED', and 'CONFIRMED'.

4. TRX_DATE: The date when the transaction occurred.

5. AMOUNT: The amount of the cash receipt. This can be a positive or negative value, likely indicating payments received or refunds issued.

6. FIRST_POSTED_RECORD_FLAG: A flag indicating whether this is the first posted record for this cash receipt. 'Y' means yes, 'N' means no.

7. POSTABLE_FLAG: A flag indicating whether this record can be posted. 'Y' means yes, 'N' means no.

8. FACTOR_FLAG: A flag that could indicate whether the cash receipt involves a factor (a third party that provides financing). 'Y' means yes, 'N' means no.

9. GL_DATE: The date when the record was posted to the General Ledger.

10. CURRENT_RECORD_FLAG: A flag indicating whether this is the current record for this cash receipt. 'Y' means yes, 'N' means no.

11. BATCH_ID: The identifier for the batch in which this cash receipt was processed. This could be used to group transactions processed together.

12. ACCOUNT_CODE_COMBINATION_ID: The identifier for the combination of account codes associated with this cash receipt.

13. REVERSAL_GL_DATE: The date when the reversal of this cash receipt was posted to the General Ledger.

14. REVERSAL_CASH_RECEIPT_HIST_ID: The identifier for the cash receipt history record of the reversal of this cash receipt.

15. FACTOR_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT: The amount of discount provided by the factor, if applicable.

16. BANK_CHARGE_ACCOUNT_CCID: The identifier for the bank charge account associated with this cash receipt.

17. POSTING_CONTROL_ID: The identifier for the posting control associated with this cash receipt.

18. REVERSAL_POSTING_CONTROL_ID: The identifier for the posting control associated with the reversal of this cash receipt.

19. GL_POSTED_DATE: The date when the cash receipt was posted to the General Ledger.

20. REVERSAL_GL_POSTED_DATE: The date when the reversal of this cash receipt was posted to the General Ledger.

This table does not appear to have explicit foreign keys linking to other tables, but several fields like CASH_RECEIPT_ID, BATCH_ID, ACCOUNT_CODE_COMBINATION_ID, BANK_CHARGE_ACCOUNT_CCID, POSTING_CONTROL_ID, and REVERSAL_POSTING_CONTROL_ID suggest relationships with other tables in the ERP system.

**Object Name:** AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPT_HISTORY_ALL

**Object Description:** 
The AR.AR_CASH_RECEIPT_HISTORY_ALL table in the Oracle ERP system contains historical data related to cash receipts. This table is used to track and manage all cash receipt transactions, including the creation, update, and reversal of these transactions. It is crucial for financial reporting, auditing, and cash flow management.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN`: This field records the ID of the last user who logged in and made changes to the record. It is used for tracking changes and auditing purposes.

2. `ACCTD_AMOUNT`: This field represents the accounted amount of the cash receipt. It is the actual amount recorded in the company's books.

3. `ACCTD_FACTOR_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT`: This field represents the accounted factor discount amount. It is the discount amount that is accounted for in the transaction.

4. `CREATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who created the record. It is used for tracking and auditing purposes.

5. `CREATION_DATE`: This field records the date and time when the record was created.

6. `EXCHANGE_DATE`: This field represents the date of the exchange rate that was used for the transaction.

7. `EXCHANGE_RATE`: This field represents the exchange rate that was used for the transaction.

8. `EXCHANGE_RATE_TYPE`: This field represents the type of exchange rate that was used for the transaction.

9. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: This field records the date and time of the last update made to the record.

10. `PROGRAM_APPLICATION_ID`: This field represents the ID of the application program that was used to create or update the record.

11. `PROGRAM_ID`: This field represents the ID of the program that was used to create or update the record.

12. `PROGRAM_UPDATE_DATE`: This field records the date of the last update made by the program to the record.

13. `REQUEST_ID`: This field represents the ID of the request that initiated the creation or update of the record.

14. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: This field records the ID of the user who last updated the record.

15. `PRV_STAT_CASH_RECEIPT_HIST_ID`: This field represents the ID of the previous status of the cash receipt history.

16. `CREATED_FROM`: This field represents the source or method from which the record was created.

17. `REVERSAL_CREATED_FROM`: This field represents the source or method from which the reversal of the record was created.

18. `ATTRIBUTE1`, `ATTRIBUTE2`, `ATTRIBUTE3`: These are placeholder fields that can be used to store additional data as required by the business.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**
The `CREATED_BY` and `LAST_UPDATED_BY` fields likely reference a user table in the database, linking each cash receipt record to the user who created or last updated it. The `PROGRAM_ID` and `PROGRAM_APPLICATION_ID` fields may reference a table of programs or applications used within the system. The `REQUEST_ID` field may reference a table of requests made within the system. The `PRV_STAT_CASH_RECEIPT_HIST_ID` field suggests that there may be a status history for each cash receipt, potentially stored in another table. The `CREATED_FROM` and `REVERSAL_CREATED_FROM` fields indicate that cash receipts can be created or reversed from various sources or methods.
