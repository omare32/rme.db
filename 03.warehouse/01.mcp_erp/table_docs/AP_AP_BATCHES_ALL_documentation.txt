**Object Name:** AP.AP_BATCHES_ALL

**Object Type:** Table/View

**Business Purpose:** The AP.AP_BATCHES_ALL object in the Oracle ERP system is designed to store information about batches of transactions in the accounts payable (AP) module. Each batch represents a group of invoices or payments that are processed together. This object is crucial for tracking and managing financial transactions, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating financial reporting and auditing.

**Column Descriptions:**

1. `BATCH_ID`: A unique identifier for each batch. This is likely the primary key for the table.

2. `BATCH_NAME`: The name given to the batch. This could be a combination of vendor name, invoice number, or other identifying information.

3. `BATCH_DATE`: The date when the batch was created or processed.

4. `LAST_UPDATE_DATE`: The date and time when the batch record was last updated.

5. `LAST_UPDATED_BY`: The identifier (likely a user ID) of the person who last updated the batch record.

6. `CONTROL_INVOICE_COUNT`: The expected number of invoices in the batch, used for control and reconciliation purposes.

7. `CONTROL_INVOICE_TOTAL`: The expected total amount of the invoices in the batch, used for control and reconciliation purposes.

8. `ACTUAL_INVOICE_COUNT`: The actual number of invoices in the batch.

9. `ACTUAL_INVOICE_TOTAL`: The actual total amount of the invoices in the batch.

10. `INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE`: The currency code of the invoice amounts in the batch.

11. `PAYMENT_CURRENCY_CODE`: The currency code used for payments in the batch.

12. `LAST_UPDATE_LOGIN`: The login ID of the user who last updated the batch record.

13. `CREATION_DATE`: The date and time when the batch record was created.

14. `CREATED_BY`: The identifier (likely a user ID) of the person who created the batch record.

15. `PAY_GROUP_LOOKUP_CODE`: A code representing the payment group associated with the batch.

16. `BATCH_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`: A unique identifier for a combination of batch codes, likely used for categorizing or grouping batches in some way.

17. `TERMS_ID`: An identifier for the payment terms associated with the batch.

18. `ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY`: A category for additional attributes or properties of the batch.

19. `ATTRIBUTE1`: An additional attribute or property of the batch.

20. `ATTRIBUTE2`: Another additional attribute or property of the batch.

**Inferred Relationships and Business Logic:**

The `BATCH_ID` is likely the primary key for this table and could be used to link to other tables or views in the database that contain batch-related information.

The `LAST_UPDATED_BY` and `CREATED_BY` fields likely relate to a user table in the database, allowing for tracking of who is making changes to the batch records.

The `CONTROL_INVOICE_COUNT` and `ACTUAL_INVOICE_COUNT`, as well as `CONTROL_INVOICE_TOTAL` and `ACTUAL_INVOICE_TOTAL`, are likely used for reconciliation purposes, ensuring that the batch contains the expected number and total amount of invoices.

The `PAY_GROUP_LOOKUP_CODE`, `BATCH_CODE_COMBINATION_ID`, and `TERMS_ID` fields likely relate to other tables or views in the database that contain additional information about payment groups, batch code combinations, and payment terms, respectively.

# AP.AP_BATCHES_ALL Table Documentation

## Overview
The AP.AP_BATCHES_ALL table is part of the Oracle ERP system. This table is designed to store information related to batches in the Accounts Payable (AP) module. Batches are groups of transactions that are processed together. The table contains various attributes related to the batches, as well as information about the invoice type, hold status, document category, organization, general ledger date, and payment priority.

## Column Descriptions

1. **ATTRIBUTE3 to ATTRIBUTE15**: These columns are designed to store additional information about the batches. The specific meaning of these attributes can vary depending on the organization's business needs and how they have configured the system. In the provided sample data, these fields are all null.

2. **INVOICE_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE**: This field indicates the type of invoice associated with the batch. In the sample data, the invoice type is 'STANDARD' for all rows.

3. **HOLD_LOOKUP_CODE**: This field indicates whether the batch is on hold. The specific codes used can vary depending on the organization's business rules. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows, suggesting that these batches are not on hold.

4. **HOLD_REASON**: If a batch is on hold, this field can provide additional information about the reason for the hold. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows.

5. **DOC_CATEGORY_CODE**: This field indicates the category of the document associated with the batch. The specific categories used can vary depending on the organization's business rules. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows.

6. **ORG_ID**: This field indicates the ID of the organization associated with the batch. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows.

7. **GL_DATE**: This field indicates the date when the batch was posted to the general ledger. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows.

8. **PAYMENT_PRIORITY**: This field indicates the priority of the payment associated with the batch. The specific priority levels used can vary depending on the organization's business rules. In the sample data, this field is null for all rows.

## Relationships and Business Logic
The AP.AP_BATCHES_ALL table likely interacts with other tables in the Oracle ERP system. For example, it may link to tables that store detailed information about invoices, organizations, and payments. The specific relationships and business logic would depend on the organization's configuration of the system and their business processes.
