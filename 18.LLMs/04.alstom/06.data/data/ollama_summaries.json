The minimum reinforcement percentage for all structural elements follows ECP-203/2020 standards, and all members were checked under the given loads.\n\nThe structure was checked for dead loads, imposed dead loads, live loads, temperature variations, wind loads, earthquake loads, and crane loads. The report includes architectural drawings, structural drawings, finite element analysis for columns, beams, secondary elements according to ASD and LRFD, and finite element analysis for the foundation (appendices A-E).\n\nIn conclusion, the Structural Revision Report provides an assessment of the safety and compatibility of structural elements in the Alstom New Cabling Factory's Production Building and Warehouse based on various design codes and loads. The report serves as a crucial document to ensure the building's structural integrity during its construction and service life.",
  "ALSTOM - STEEL SHED (1) STRUCTURAL REVISION REPORT.pdf": " Title: ALSTOM - Steel Shed (1) Structural Revision Report\n   Date: May 2025\n   Project: Alstom New Cabling Factory - Steel Shed (1)\n   Location: Borg Al -Arab, Alexandria, Egypt\n\nInfinity Consulting Office was assigned to review the structural design of Steel Shed (1), a part of the Alstom New Cabling Factory in Egypt. The report presents the structural analysis performed and safety checks for all structural elements.\n\nThe structure consists of foundations, tie beams, slab on grade, steel columns, steel beams, secondary elements, steel connections, steel bracing, and steel base plates.\n\nScope of work includes reviewing the compatibility of architectural drawings with structural ones, performing analysis for all structural elements, and checking safety for each element.\n\nThe structure was analyzed using ETABS 20, SAFE 2020, and SAP 2000 programs. Materials properties were assigned based on Egyptian codes for design and construction of reinforced concrete structures, steel construction, and bridge ASD (Allowable Stress Design).\n\nReinforced Concrete Grades are 35.0 MPa for all structural elements, except for slab on grade with a grade of 30.0 MPa. Steel grades include Grade 52 for all bus steel sections, Grade 44 for rolled steel sections, and Grade 52 for cold-formed steel sections. The clear cover to reinforcement is 40.0 mm for columns, 35.0 mm for beams, 50.0 mm for foundations, slab on grade, and reinforcing steel grade is 420.0 MPa for all structural elements.\n\nThe structure will be checked under characteristic Dead Loads (DL), Imposed Dead Loads, Live Loads (LL), Temperature, Wind Loads, and Earthquake Loads. The design loads also include Super Imposed Loads and Live Loads.\n\nIn conclusion, the report presents the structural analysis of Steel Shed (1) for the Alstom New Cabling Factory in Egypt, using various programs and Egyptian codes. Safety checks were performed for all structural elements, including foundations, tie beams, slab on grade, steel columns, steel beams, secondary elements, steel connections, steel bracing, and steel base plates.",
  "ALSTOM - STEEL SHED (2) STRUCTURAL REVISION REPORT.pdf": " The document is a Structural Revision Report for Steel Shed (2) at Alstom New Cable Factory in Borg Al-Arab, Alexandria, Egypt. The report was prepared by INFINITY Consulting Office upon request from Rowad Modern Engineering to review the structural design of all elements in the project.\n\nThe scope of work includes:\n1. Reviewing the compatibility of architectural drawings with structural drawings.\n2. Performing analysis on all structural elements.\n3. Checking safety for all structural elements.\n\nStructural elements being checked include foundations, tie beams, slab on grade, steel columns, steel beams, secondary elements, steel connections, steel bracing, and steel base plates. The structure was analyzed using ETABS 2023, SAFE 2020, and SAP 2000 software programs. Material properties were assigned according to Egyptian codes of practice for design and construction of reinforced concrete structures, steel construction, and bridge ASD.\n\nThe materials used in the structure include:\n1. Steel grades: All BUS steel sections (fy = 3.6 t/cm2), Rolled steel sections (fy = 2.8 t/cm2), Cold-formed steel sections (fy = 52), Reinforced Concrete Grades for all structural elements (fcu = 35.0 MPa), and Reinforced Concrete Grades for slab on grade (fcu = 30.0 MPa).\n2. Bolts grades: M24 Grade (8.8) for connections, M12 Grade (4.6) for purlins, ST.52/36 for anchored bolts.\n3. Clear cover to reinforcement: Columns = 40.0 mm, Beams = 35.0 mm, Foundations = 50.0 mm, Slab on Grade = 50.0 mm.\n4. Reinforcing steel grade: Reinforcement (f y) =  420.0 for all structural elements.\n\nDesign loads considered are characteristic Dead Loads, Imposed Dead Loads, Live Loads, Temperature, Wind Loads, and Earthquake Loads. The structure is checked for normal weights of various materials like steel members, concrete, mortar, soil, blocks, and sandwiche panels as well as live loads like live load for accessible roofs and fabrication/maintenance loads.\n\nThe report also includes architectural drawings (Appendix A) and structural drawings (Appendix B), finite element analysis for columns, beams, and secondary elements (Appendix C), and finite element analysis for foundation (Appendix D)."
