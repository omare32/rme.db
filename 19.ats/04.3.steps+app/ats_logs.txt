> 3.0 Working principle

The stirrer of this machine is driven by the motor, and the rotation of the
stirrer inputs mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle.

mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle, so that the fluid obtains
a suitable flow field, in which momentum, heat, mass

The process of momentum, heat and mass transfer or chemical reaction
is carried out in the flow field at the same time. The stirrer of this machine is
connected with the stirring shaft by keys and bolts, which has good
transmission efficiency, is not easy to slip, and is easy to dismantle and
install.

The dispersing disc of this machine, driven by the motor, generates
rotating tangential high linear velocity, and the material, under the action of
huge centrifugal force, generates powerful hydraulic shear and high-frequency
mechanical effect, so that the fluid material is subjected to thousands of times
of shear and high-frequency mechanical effect per minute, to achieve the effect

of high-efficiency mixing, dispersing and homogenizing.

Horizontal screw belt mixer is widely used in various industries such as chemical
industry, medicine, compound fertiliser, dyestuff, pigment, rubber, building
materials, food, milk powder, health care products, feed, additives, aquaculture,
bio-engineering, fine chemical industry, ceramics, refractory materials, rare earths,

plastic-like, puffed and so on, and other matching materials mixing.

Il. the performance characteristics

This machine has high mixing uniformity, does not produce stratification and
segregation phenomenon, no deposition, heat-sensitive materials will not produce
red heat, the particles will not be pressure feed and grinding, the specific gravity
of the material also has a better adaptability, solid and solid mixing in the ratio of 1
to 1000, the standard deviation of three parts per 100,000 to eight, content
fluctuation error <2% (variance factor). Discharging adopts long type discharging
valve, quick discharging, fast mixing speed, sealed operation, large loading
coefficient, occupies an area of less, does not need high room foundation, use,
maintenance, cleaning are very convenient.

Ill. Working Principle

This machine is a horizontal U-type body, with spraying, adding liquid device, by
the movement of the mixing shaft spiral belt, so that the internal and external
spiral belt in a wider range of turning materials, the internal spiral belt will be the
material to both sides of the movement, the external spiral belt will be the material
from both sides of the movement of the material inward movement so that the

material back and forth seepage mixing, and the other part of the material by the

SOWERS#
spiral belt picking under the radial movement along the axial direction, so as to

form a convection cycle. As a result of the above movement of the mixing, the
material in a short period of time to obtain rapid and uniform mixing. Therefore, it
is a kind of high-efficiency mixer with wide application, strong adaptability and
good effect.

> 3.0 Working principle

The stirrer of this machine is driven by the motor, and the rotation of the
stirrer inputs mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle.

mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle, so that the fluid obtains
a suitable flow field, in which momentum, heat, mass

The process of momentum, heat and mass transfer or chemical reaction
is carried out in the flow field at the same time. The stirrer of this machine is
connected with the stirring shaft by keys and bolts, which has good
transmission efficiency, is not easy to slip, and is easy to dismantle and
install.

The dispersing disc of this machine, driven by the motor, generates
rotating tangential high linear velocity, and the material, under the action of
huge centrifugal force, generates powerful hydraulic shear and high-frequency
mechanical effect, so that the fluid material is subjected to thousands of times
of shear and high-frequency mechanical effect per minute, to achieve the effect

of high-efficiency mixing, dispersing and homogenizing.

> 3.0 Working principle

The stirrer of this machine is driven by the motor, and the rotation of the
stirrer inputs mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle.

mechanical energy to the fluid inside the kettle, so that the fluid obtains
a suitable flow field, in which momentum, heat, mass

The process of momentum, heat and mass transfer or chemical reaction
is carried out in the flow field at the same time. The stirrer of this machine is
connected with the stirring shaft by keys and bolts, which has good
transmission efficiency, is not easy to slip, and is easy to dismantle and
install.

The dispersing disc of this machine, driven by the motor, generates
rotating tangential high linear velocity, and the material, under the action of
huge centrifugal force, generates powerful hydraulic shear and high-frequency
mechanical effect, so that the fluid material is subjected to thousands of times
of shear and high-frequency mechanical effect per minute, to achieve the effect

of high-efficiency mixing, dispersing and homogenizing.

BRIEF

As a software engineer with a strong background in civil engineering, I'm passionate about bringing these
two fields together. My goal is to make life easier for engineers in all areas by using automation to avoid
repetitive work and minimize mistakes.

What drives me is the idea of a future where engineers can focus on solving problems instead of doing
tedious tasks. I want to make a real difference in the engineering world by improving how things are done
and making them more efficient and to help engineers work smarter, not harder.
