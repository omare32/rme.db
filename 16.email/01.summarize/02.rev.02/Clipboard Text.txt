no thank you, will get to that later, now they need a microsoft teams message to be sent with this weeks emails summary, so we ll need a third cell that reads this week's emails (starting sunday) and sends a teams message for every mail thats summarized , meaning no more use of api, we will only take from the mysql database the already made summaries and send a message with the details of the mail (sender and data/time) then the generated summary (each message will have one email cause i dont want the message to be crowded), i m making a webhook right now in a team channel to give it to you for you to write me the 3rd cell , https://rowadmodern.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/ce25bf04-ccbf-4bab-93c8-a9fb15c6dcc3@7c9607e1-cd01-4c4f-a163-c7f2bb6284a4/IncomingWebhook/03d26eecc7d848e5a4ddcd00b1a8397b/24f28753-9c07-40e0-91b2-ea196c200a33/V2kuNhFVAirW-CH6dS3ChtWfwMVh0oq9lXHL_HbvSkL9A1
